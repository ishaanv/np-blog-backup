<p><a href="http://www.buildingfutures.org.uk/projects/building-futures/the-future-for-architects"><img class="alignright" title="in 10 years..." src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Future_for_Architects_website.jpg" alt="" width="354" height="236" /></a>BD ran an article today, provocatively titled "<a href="http://www.bdonline.co.uk/5013898.article">Change or die, RIBA tells architects</a>" about the report - "<a title="Intro and PDF for download here" href="http://www.buildingfutures.org.uk/projects/building-futures/the-future-for-architects">The Future for Architects? Who Will Design Our Buildings in 2025?</a>" - that the RIBA will launch on the 1<sup>st</sup> of March.  This is a subject that runs nicely parallel to the initial thread of my diploma thesis, so I immediately pricked up my ears when I saw it.</p>
