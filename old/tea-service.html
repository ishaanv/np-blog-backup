<p>Last week I got up, made myself some breakfast, then went downstairs to <a href="http://www.theunbearablelightnessofbeinghungry.com/2010/10/room-10-potts-point.html">Room 10</a> and had a coffee, and went to get my hair cut. I'm in the terminal stages of going bald so I've been splashing out on hair cuts because over my whole life I'll be spending next to nothing on haircare.<br />
<img class="alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bodum-4-c-assam-tea-press1161.jpg" alt="tea plunger" height="100" />When I arrived at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Our-Place-Salon/119047551466394">Our Place</a> I was offered a cup of tea. Like any self respecting Englishman I accepted. Clive is from somewhere near Cambridge I think, so it feels like some sort of expatriate solidarity to take tea. A few minutes later I was brought a plunger of lovely looking tea, a little jug of milk, some sugar sachets and a cup.<br />
Having just come from a place where if you order a take away coffee they even put the sugar in for you, this started my mind rumbling. So as Clive was washing my hair (more of a token activity as there is so little of it) I started thinking...<br />
In general service industries take away things that get in between you and your goal. In the case of the take away coffee, your goal is to get coffee into your mouth as soon as you can; faffing about with putting the sugar in is a faff that can be avoided by a 'value add' by a good barista.<br />
So what is it about tea service that sets it apart from this trend? There are a few obvious answers, but none of them is very satisfactory on their own, and there might be some semblance of an answer lurking in between them all.</p>
<ul>
<li> The ceremony of tea service is at least as important as the consumable end product. Tea has a long history of being prepared as an elaborate process, and that process has been infused with meaning (no pun intended). Over time we (our society) have forgotten what that meaning is, but we still remember that there is meaning even if we don't know what it is (is this what philosophers would call normative pressure?). I think that this falls down as a way of explaining the prevalence of tea's complicated serving method because the provision of many other drinks and services have a lot of ceremony in their history, and that seems to have fallen away. In the traditional Japanese tea ceremony the tea is prepared by the tea master, and served to the guests. The guests do very little in the actual preparation. This is pretty similar to the Ethiopian coffee preparation ceremony that starts with green beans and ends several hours later with a cup. Neither require the guest to make the drink. So how did the tea ceremony get comodified, but coffee totally lost it's history? [Needs a bit of work!]</li>
<li>Tea needs to visually show off it's quality</li>
<li>Tea is a personal thing, and needs to be made to a very exact specification. This one is particularly odd. Being able to make tea for someone you know is a very intimate thing; it implies that you know them and their tastes. This sounds like a good reason for leaving the last steps of the tea prep to the drinker, but that rationale could apply to a lot of services, and usually the reason that you'd go to someone who would provide a service is that they can do it better than we can. Surely someone professional can make an awesome cup of tea, so it can't be their ability to make it specificaly to our tastes or we'd develop a better vocabulary for ordering tea.</li>
<li>The most convincing argument for the coffee-tea argument is that most coffee we have now is espresso, and espresso has only been around since the second world war, whereas the tea making process of putting leaves in water is much older. Because espresso requires special machinery it is</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these reasons really explain why</p>
