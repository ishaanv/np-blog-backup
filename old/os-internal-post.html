<p>You know what's really annoying? Lots of things actually, but one of them is this:<!--more--></p>
<figure>
<blockquote><p>Us: "Look, we can't have the logo looking like that. You've changed the colour, the aspect ratio and you've made it into a rastafarian flag held by a laser cat."</p>
<p>Them: "But it looked lonely out on its own. You didn't say what I should do with it, so I <em>improvised!</em>"</p></blockquote>
<figcaption>The conversation we have every time we sponsor an event.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But they have a point! Our graphic standards are totally internal. That means that we know how to use the logo. In explicit detail!</p>
<p>There is a lot of work that goes into making a consistent graphic identity. The problem is that nobody who we give the logo to, the people who are making sponsor posters, have any idea about all that work!</p>
<h1>The front end</h1>
<p>We've solved that problem!</p>
<p>From now on you can send people to this address[1. what is the address? Should it be the gh one or should it get it's own? there are .style tlds and bvn.style is available] and they can see all the graphic guidelines and get all the assets they need. That will mean that they have everything they need to use those assets in line with our intent.</p>
<p>It also means that you can check the graphic guidelines from your phone or your computer whenever you want. The tropos menu points to that location, and you can save the address as a bookmark in your phone.</p>
<p>Having one source of information for everyone (internal and external) means that the information is always current. There's no risk of the info going out of alignment because one version has been updated and the other hasn't.</p>
<h1>The back end</h1>
<p>The style guide is hosted on GitHub. That means that it's open source. It means that anyone in the world can contribute to the style guide.</p>
<p>Clutch the pearls! What horrors are we letting ourselves in for? The way GitHub works is very structured. More so than Wikipedia. Contributions are handled through a <a>pull request</a>. That means that the contributor is <em>requesting</em> that the owner of the content <em>pulls</em> in their changes. That gives us, the owners, total control. The upside is that it also gives anyone the chance to fix typos and little mistakes really easily.</p>
<h1>Trickle down benefits</h1>
<p>One of <em>my</em> greatest frustrations is that architects seem to spend more time trying to thwart each other than help each other. This is a move to help our peers. If they want to take our style guide and use all or parts of it themselves then that's great. It positions us a leaders.</p>
<p>In a tiny way, it also reduces friction at the boundaries between collaborators. If we work with someone who uses the same standards as we do, then things are simpler. We can spend more time doing what we should be doing and less time fixing.</p>
<h1>Launch early and often</h1>
<p>This is a bit of a war cry of startup culture. The idea is that the only way to find out if people actually want something is to get it in front of them. This means that we can avoid spending time worrying over details that nobody cares about, when we're actually missing something huge that really matters. At BVN we are particularly guilty of launching late and once. This is understandable because buildings are a bit hard to launch early and often[1. but not impossible I'm sure!].</p>
<p>Something on the web is never <em>finished</em>, there is always more to do. If we wait until we're finished we'll never launch, so we're launching today.</p>
<h1>How can you help?</h1>
<p>If you spot something that needs to be fixed, if you feel like some wording should be changed, anything, then you can help.</p>
<p>Submit an issue ticket, or even better a pull request, and we'll sort it out.</p>
<p>Details of how to do that are <a>here on Bloomfire</a>.</p>
