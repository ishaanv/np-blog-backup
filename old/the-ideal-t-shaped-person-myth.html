<p>My first introduction to the idea of the 'T' shaped person was about three years ago. <a title="Rob's page at Simon Fraser" href="http://www.siat.sfu.ca/faculty/Rob-Woodbury/">Rob Woodbury</a> was talking at the <a href="http://www.bentley.com/en-US/Promo/SmartGeometry/archive.htm#2007">2007 SG conference in New York</a>. I've thought that it was a great metaphor for describing people, a kind of personality synaesthesia. Being the obtuse weirdo I am I started to think about other shapes of people.</p>
<p>The obvious things that come to mind are the thickness of the top of the T, or if the leg gets really pointy at the end. Then I pretty much forgot about it for a while.</p>
<p>Recently I was reading a book about mountaineering, and the section on what to if there is lightening was interesting.</p>

<p>2xT = spark</p>
<p>pure T allows no internal spark</p>
