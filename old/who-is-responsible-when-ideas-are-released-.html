<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Without risking becoming too meta, the plan is to try and write a lot more while I'm on this holiday. I have a hunch that when I write, it makes the idea I'm writing about stronger, but also makes a space for more ideas in my brain. Perhaps, ideas aren't like physical material, unable to pack more into a small space. Writing about an idea makes it more well-understood, foundational, able to have new ideas built unto it. It doesn't [inaudible 00:00:28] responsibility for it to the page, if training the mind pulled up the air effortlessly.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> Today, I've been mulling over the morality of sharing information. I'm a strong advocate of open [inaudible 00:00:41] context. I don't often see cases where keeping information private or restricting free speech is a benefit. <a href="http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2015/09/the-virtuous-homophobe/">Practical Ethics had a piece</a> on a lady in the USA who is convicted for contempt for refusing to issue marriage certificates to gay couples. They condemned her actions, as I do, but they commended her virtues for standing up for what she believes in. They made a compelling argument that if the opposite had been that we would have held her in high esteem. (I.e. that she had insisted against the law in issuing marriage certificates)</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> This is almost certainly not the first time someone has noticed good qualities in bad people. Angie Hobbs did a whole <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04pc7w4">History of Ideas on beauty</a> and whether Nazi musicians could make great music (e.g. Hitler is undisputedly an effective orator). Thought I've been mulling over today is the net benefit of sharing that kind of opinion. It would be bad for politician to be seen to endorse the virtue of the trait, but not its expression. The public wouldn’t get the nuance of the point. A subset may even see it as an endorsement of the bad person. Perhaps there are certain ideas that should be controlled. Information about making nuclear or chemical weapons pick up off these techniques.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> I'm inclined to think that this sort of information shouldn’t be controlled, but maybe I'll change my mind if I think more about it. It is that now it's just in gun control. Is there a responsibility to present a dangerous idea in a way that renders it safe, or at least as safe as possible? I'm not sure if that's enforceable. Maybe it's not even desirable. Perhaps the responsibility is on the reader to think carefully about how the words are affecting their brain.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> The more I think about this, the more I'm sure that it must be a well-discussed topic. I noticed myself using that as a mechanism for not worrying about it. I need to decide if I'm interested in this topic because I enjoy rolling ideas that I've deemed novel around in my head, or is it because I actually want an answer? Perhaps it has no value to me at the moment, but I've laid the foundation to build it up quickly, if I do find a need, like Japan's virtual nuclear weapons capability. I'm going to keep writing and blogging about ideas and my thoughts and I should get at least a basic understanding of the possible positions on this topic: who is responsible when ideas are released?</span></span></span></p>
