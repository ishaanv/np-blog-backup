<p style="text-align: right;">Quote from Alex Lee upon opening his BVN inbox for the first time.</p>
<p>That's probably going to embarrass Alex a bit, but I think it helps to have a fresh set of eyes on things.</p>
<p>Our inboxes are supposed to be for important things. Imagine yourself in a Madmen scene. You are an Important Person. Twice a day you go through your actual-paper inbox. Wouldn't you be sad if it was full of low value junk?</p>
<p><img class="alignnone" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/07ff68d66bb94a838a4bc3d2c27e5115.gif" alt="" width="500" height="287" /></p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_2648" align="alignright" width="359"]<img class="wp-image-2648 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bir.png" alt="" width="359" height="127" /> This is not anyone's fault. There isn't currently a place for us to have this kind of communication that doesn't pollute the inbox.[/caption]</p>
<p>So many emails that are valuable to someone, but not everyone, start with "<em>Sorry for the group email but...</em>". We don't have an effective way to keep that kind of communication out of the inbox.</p>
<p>The reason we don't have an effective way to do this is not enough eyeballs!</p>

<p>Email inboxes are the only place that we know that lots of people look, so that's where we direct our questions. What if that wasn't true? How could we do that?</p>
<p>Well, we have Slack. We started using slack for the Commons, but there's no reason not to extend it even further. Chris has <a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/07/09/join-slack-the-commons-platform-for-communication-of-ideas/">written about slack before</a> and lots of people have signed up. What would be really great is if everyone signed up, then we'd have the network effect we need to take the pressure off email.</p>
<p>Slack has channels, they are a bit like radio stations. You subscribe to the channels that you want to. So if you are into ESD, there's a channel for that, there's a channel for rosa to announce library things etc. We can make channels for anything.</p>
<p>That means that there's a fence around the topic. That keeps the topic focused, it means that you know where to look to get information back again. Most importantly, it allows you to focus on only the things that you care about right now.</p>
<p>You can get an app on your phone too, so you can catch up on the latest from the ping pong tournament on the train.</p>
<p>We don't have any official rules about how to use it, so lets all evolve those rules together. Also, use a bit of common sense, don't upload DoD documents to it or anything dumb like that.</p>
<p>Go, sign up, suggest channels and let's have a joyous new world where we're excellent at communicating!</p>
