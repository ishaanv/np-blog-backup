<p>Whenever I tell people about Posted Notes[1. On one hand Posted Notes is an expensive hobby (with a ratio of income to time spent that would put me somewhere in the bottom billion) but I'm putting a much more positive spin on things and thinking of it as an incredibly low cost education!]Â they give me one of two responses.</p>
<ol>
<li>"That is great! Getting letters is lovely but I'm never organised enough to actually send them[1. Although, like me, a lot of people say that they write them and then carry them around until they are so out of date or tatty that they throw them out!]."</li>
<li>"That is the worst! Sending letters is really personal and my aunt Mavis would be devastated if she found out that I'd outsourced sending letters"<br />
There isn't really any rebuke to response 2, they are entirely right. When you send a letter to your aunt Mavis you are communicating that you still think about her enough to undertake the logistical marathon of getting a letter into a postbox. I'm not going to argue that you should be using posted notes for that - you shouldn't!<br />
The real use for posted notes is to bring a smile to the face of someone who would be happy with an email, but it's a welcome surprise to get something a bit different.<br />
Here's a simple way to think about it:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>Posted is not there to make your life easier by writing the letters you <em>were</em> going write; it exists to write the letters that you <em>weren't</em> going to write!</p></blockquote>
<p>All the thank you letters you briefly thought about before you were distracted by more prosaic things, all the Facebook messages that you sent but wished they were more exciting. It's only 789 characters so you can't write a treatise of undying love or argue about who really invented calculus.</p>
<p>Remember the content is all yours, all we do is render it visible.</p>
