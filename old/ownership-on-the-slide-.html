<p>Anyone who has been forced to listen to me <a title="Driverless cars" href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/?p=1419">ranting about driverless cars </a>will have seen me go off on some pretty tenuous tangents. I followed one of these the other day and ended up pretty much writing off the concept of ownership soon.</p>
<p>It started as the standard 'isn't <a href="https://www.uber.com/">uber</a> good' conversation, but if they follow through to the obvious conclusion and become the provider of the 'transport as a service'</p>
