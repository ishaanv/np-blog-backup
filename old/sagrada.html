<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">All the romance of living on a boat has worn off. After three nights of almost no sleep, we're both like zombies. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> We just went around the inside of the Sagrada Familia. It's overwhelming and it's made more so by one's inner ears, when one's inner ears are playing tricks. It's probably the last cathedral that will be built as a multi-generational devotional project. Maybe the last project at all that's motivated by something other than profit and KPIs. It seems to be driven by an interpretation of religion that I can identify with. The kind that drove [mutant 00:00:36] and [likeness 00:00:37] to outdo each other in piety. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> By funneling all that was possible, with such limited power of geometrical tricks, Gaudi was pushing the envelope of the realm of the possible. Having seen first hand the effect, the effort it takes to get parts of that building built, it's incredible that so much of it's done. It really is meta-design. The invisible hand of Gaudi defining what can and can't be done, then broadly designing the result. Designing a system, then exercising the system to search for an acceptable result. It all requires an enormous force of will. To plan that far in advance, more than a hundred years, needs a subject matter that barely changes. This church has taken five percent of the whole of Christianity's lifespan to build. The Catholic Church is incredibly resistant to change, so I'd imagine that in another couple of five percents it'll still be fine. </span></span></span></p>
