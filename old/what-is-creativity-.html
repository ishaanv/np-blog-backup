<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">This morning's breakfast at Dishoom turned into a pretty wide-ranging discussion on the ethics of killing in video games and how that was going to change when NPCs were more AI than mechanism. Eventually we got onto the subject of what is creativity, which we've been batting around for a few months now. I feel like we made some progress today. I'll try and start from the start.</span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> People who self-label as "creative" annoy me. So do people who self-label as "not creative." The whole concept feels wrong to me. Perhaps I just learned it incorrectly, but I don't think that's the case. I think creating is something to do with bringing new things into the world. That thing needs to be, in some way, novel. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> Maybe the first sticking point I came across is a dividing line between creating and producing. What's the difference between creativists and productivity? By dictionary definitions, these two are quite similar; synonymous, even. Modern parlance has elevated creativity to be something to be worshiped and productivity to be something to be nice to have. Productivity is a necessary for being functional in life, but it doesn't have any kind of value judgment. Punching out widgets faster than the next guy is productive, regardless of those widgets' usefulness. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> One thing we both agree on is that creativity requires production to exist. Production is the birth of the creativity, or it would remain trapped in the mind womb. People who claim to be creative worry me. Creativity should be obvious in its manifestation. The obvious counterargument to that is that people who work with pure thought stuff might not get the creative label. Newton might not have been regarded as creative if it hadn't been forced to public. Even one whose sole job is to voice ideas can be creative if they speak the idea to another. What isn't creative, in my definition, is to hang out with quirky artistic people. Creativity isn't conferred by socialization. </span></span></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;"> All this we'd thrashed out on numerous bus-to-work discussions. The new insight from Dishoom is that different jobs have different amounts of the two, almost as a gradient. Some jobs are pure productivity and others are more creative. Mathematics and theoretical physics are the high-creativity version of high-productivity engineering. Philosophy is the high-creativity version of law. I'll see what Seb things of this. I'm still not sure what motivates me to care about this niche definitional issue. Maybe it's that it niggles me, but when that's amplified by how much everyone else seems that someone ought to care about it.</span></span></span></p>
