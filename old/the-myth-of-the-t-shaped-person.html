<p>Some posts take longer to come to fruition than others, and I think that so far, this one is the longest!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sial.rmit.edu.au/Projects/Smart_Geometry.php"><img class="alignnone" title="an image pinched from the SIAL website" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/SG%20on%20SIAL%20web-%20conference%20image2.jpg" alt="" width="100%" /></a><br />
<img class="alignright" title="T_02" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/T_02.png" alt="" width="160" height="91" />In 2007 at the <a title="The videos are hare, but behind a free login" href="http://www.bentley.com/en-US/Promo/SmartGeometry/2007/index.htm">Smart Geometry Conference in New York at Cooper Union</a>, <a title="The WOODBERGER!!!!" href="http://www.siat.sfu.ca/faculty/Rob-Woodbury/">Rob Woodbury</a> gave a talk about the T shaped person. He was relating the concept, borrowed from..., that in order to be a good computational designer you needed to exhibit a T shaped skill profile. The idea is that you have a broad base of skills, and then a deep understanding of your chosen subject; something like having a well rounded education in everything, and a PhD in making molecular nano machines that are specifically for making <a href="http://karthikr.wordpress.com/2006/03/19/nano-smiley-face-made-from-dna/">smiley faces out of DNA</a>. So your broad general knowledge is the top of your T and your deep knowledge of tiny factories is the leg.<br />
The idea was (and I must apologise to Rob if I misrepresent him; it was a very long time ago) that you needed to know a fair bit about being an architect, and a hell of a lot about being a programmer. At the time I thought that this argument had a lot going for it, but then eventually something started niggling at me - it was the fact that Rob wasn't T shaped, and neither were any of the other people who I thought were useful and interesting.</p>
