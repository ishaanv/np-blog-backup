<p>I'm creeping along, trying to second guess the car in front as they weave about, they're indicating right even though there isn't anywhere to go - this person must be drunk. But it's 11am on a week day.<!--more--></p>
<p>Having a motorbike makes one acutely aware of all the ways that other road users can try to kill you. Mostly through having poor awareness of their environment or having slow reaction times. The assailant in the first paragraph wasn't drunk, well I doubt they were, but they were dealing with a car full of rowdy kids. It set me wondering, did it matter <em>why</em> someone's performance as a road-co-user is impaired or just <em>that</em> it is?</p>
<p>Why do we pick on drunk people driving cars so enthusiastically? Seems like a measurement issue. It's easy to test if someone is drunk and they will continue to be drunk for the rest of their journey. If they are on the phone or dealing with rowdy kids then they, at the point of testing, will probably <em>not</em> be displaying signs of decreased driving ability. There's also no way I can think of to measure if people are just bad drivers; do they use their wing mirrors, do they <em>care</em> about the other people on the road.</p>
<p>This all makes sense to me, the legal system only allows for things that are easy and fairly unambiguous to catch, so it's probably not really worth going after people driving in a hazy bubble of air-con and Britney Spears. What surprises me is that there isn't a stronger normative bias against being a car-texter[1. <a title="Good beard strength in this video!" href="http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/brookes-last-fatal-text-are-you-still-going-to-make-it-today-20130612-2o3tt.html">NSW</a> seems to be pretty into telling people not to text in the car, as is the <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21579795-hands-free-texting-more-distracting-drivers-using-mobile-phone-keep?fsrc=scn/fb/wl/pe/keepyourmindontheroad">Economist</a>] or distracted parent[1. Distracted parents can be <a title="Overcrowding may have caused fatal car crash" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/overcrowding-may-have-caused-fatal-car-crash-492652.html">pretty fatal</a>.].</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure if my friends thought that I drove drunk then a fair few of them would stop being my friend, but they'd probably mind a lot less if they thought that every so often I check my phone[1. I don't do either of these things, if I could get my phone out and take my glove off between gear shifts it'd be a complete miracle!]. I've heard people talk about how little they use their wing mirrors, and parents complaining about their kids unruliness in social situations without rebuke.</p>
<p>Why don't these things end up as social norms, frowned upon as hazards to the safety of others as drinking? I wonder if it's because there's no explicit law? If a technological way of checking your alertness, reaction time, general awareness etc. could be found, would we be into it? Would we drop explicit laws that say that driving drunk is statistically a bad idea, and say that if you are able to operate above a certain threshold then you are free to operate your vehicle? I have a feeling that society would be against it, old people, people with slow reactions, people who are tired, distracted or just generally shit drivers would be 'discriminated against', but the road safety stats would support it. My guess is that the compelling rhetoric of anti-discrimination would win over statistical improvement[1. this is a really tricky subject, there are lots of local maxima that would lead to an overall moral coarsening.].</p>
<p>As usual this is more about me writing down questions, but if you have any thoughts I'd love to hear them</p>
