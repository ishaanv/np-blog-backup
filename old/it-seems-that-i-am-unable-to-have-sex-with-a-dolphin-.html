<p>I thought that I'd do something a bit special for my 200<sup>th</sup> post.</p>
<p>It seems that dolphins are in a very small minority[1. The view that the set of species that has sex for pleasure is small is disputed, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_sexual_behaviour#Sex_for_pleasure">wikipedia </a>of all places!  I'm inclined to agree] in the animal kingdom in that they have sex for pleasure[2. anal, oral, vaginal and blowhole sex <a href="http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/54890/">according to</a> the <a href="http://www.museumofsex.com/exhibit/sex-lives-of-animals">Museum of Sex</a>].</p>
<blockquote><p>Law in this country is very clear cut, unusually so.</p>
<p>Section 69 (lol) of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 covers "Intercourse with an animal"</p>
<ol>
<li>A person commits an offence if—
<ol type="a">
<li>he intentionally performs an act of penetration with his penis,</li>
<li>what is penetrated is the vagina or anus of a living animal, and</li>
<li>he knows that, or is reckless as to whether, that is what is penetrated.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A person (A) commits an offence if—
<ol type="a">
<li>A intentionally causes, or allows, A’s vagina or anus to be penetrated,</li>
<li>the penetration is by the penis of a living animal, and</li>
<li>A knows that, or is reckless as to whether, that is what A is being penetrated by.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Punishment is up to 2 years imprisonment (it used to be life)</p>
<p>Pornographic material involving the same acts are also prohibited by Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008 in the controversial 'extreme pornographic material' section.<br />
Its pretty draconian:</p>
<p>The prohibition is on images showing:<br />
"a person performing or appearing to perform an act of intercourse or oral sex with an animal (whether dead or alive), and a reasonable person looking at the image would think that any such person or animal was real."</p>
<p>Sentience and consent are dead issues, animals at law cannot consent to intercourse with humans, however, contrast that with vivisection or breeding. Seems to me to be very hypocritical that some primates (admittedly not great apes) can be lobotomised and dog breeders can force their bitches to become pregnant but a loving farmer can't have sex with his flock.</p>
<p>A lacuna in the law Ben.</p></blockquote>
