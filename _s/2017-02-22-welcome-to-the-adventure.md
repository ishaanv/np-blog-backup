Hello!
I'm glad you've signed up for this course. It's going to be fun.

To prepare for the course you don't really need to _do_ anything just yet. If you are a super keen bean, you can install [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)[^1] ready for the first class.

[^1]: if your laptop is a work one, check with your IT bods that virtualisation will work. Some laptops---Lenovo and HP are prime ones for this---and if you are on your own machine then it's easy to change, but if you are on a work computer there might be a bios password that you don't have. Better to be safe than sorry.

If you are _still_ keen, you could make a start on some of the [reading](https://notionparallax.co.uk/CODE1161/2017-01-01-1161-outline#lectures).

You could also get an account with these guys:

1. [GitHub](https://github.com/)
2. [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
3. [Medium](https://medium.com/)

Otherwise, just take it easy, reorganise your calendar to give yourself some free time, and I'll see you on the 3<sup>rd</sup> of April.
