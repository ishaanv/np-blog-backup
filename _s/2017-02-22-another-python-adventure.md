You've heard about the power of Python. Perhaps you think that it comes from a big snake. :snake: Perhaps you know that it's actually a programming language, but quite what that means you aren't sure. Maybe you've even marvelled at someone wielding it's immense power and wished that you could be a little bit more like them.

If you are one of a lucky band of 14 brave, snake charming, proto-nerds then you can learn the secrets of the giant snake!

The [Sydney Computational Design Group](https://www.meetup.com/Sydney-computational-design-group/) is trying something new. We're going to run a Python course to teach the skills you'll need to start taking charge of the world around you with code.

The course will run on Tuesday evenings, from 6--8:30. It'll be at [BVN's studio](https://goo.gl/maps/DHHBXW4FGyn). It'll start on the ~~14<sup>th</sup> of March~~ 3<sup>rd</sup> of April and run for ~~14~~ 10 weeks, with a ~~week off in week 7~~. (You can also stop at that point if you need your Mondays~~Tuesdays~~ back.)

The course will be in two halves. The first part will be about learning the language, and how to use it. The second half will apply it to an urban-scale, open-data project.

It'll be taught by [Ben Doherty](https://notionparallax.co.uk/). It'll be a mirror of the UNSW course CODE1161, which Ben is also teaching. That is the core course for the computational design degree's first year. The course is already fully planned out; you can [see the materials here](https://notionparallax.co.uk/CODE1161). Because we'll be a smaller group, we will be able to move a bit faster, so we can have slightly shorter sessions. It assumes no prior knowledge of programming at all. If you can work a VCR or post a Facebook status you are already ahead of the requirements.

"_How much will this heady extravaganza set me back?_" you ask. We're trialling an odd way of doing things. The course will be $200, but if you pass the whole thing you get $200 back! Also, like a Sydney bus, if you tap off after the first half you get $100 back. This seems like lunacy, but we'll see.

You'll need your own laptop and the ability to install things. The course is taught on a virtual machine which keeps the course stuff separate to the rest of your computer.

Here's a summary of the exact details:
* ~~13~~ 10 classes that will teach you how to use the basics of python.
* 6pm--8:30pm on ~~Tuesdays~~ Mondays.
* Pay up front, get the money back if you complete the course.
* Get $100 back if you stop at the half way point.
* [Course outline here](https://notionparallax.co.uk/CODE1161/2017-01-01-1161-outline).
