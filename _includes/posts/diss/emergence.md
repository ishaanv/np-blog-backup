<p class="inter-paragraph">The complexity involved in the final form of something like a wool thread model can usually be reduced to a surprisingly simple set of rules. The study of complexity generated from simple systems becomes very interesting, positive or negative feedback can send a system off into total chaos, or keep it from really doing anything. These mathematical concepts can be applied to natural phenomena such as the wax and wane of caribou populations[^11] or the arrangement of seeds in a sunflower head.</p>
<p class="inter-paragraph">So if nature holds such fascinating structural mathematics then what happens if we abstract those rules and apply them to architecture? This is exactly what the Emergence and Design Group have done.</p>

In 1917 D’arcy Thompson published a book called ‘On Growth and Form’ which studies the structure of complex single cell organisms[^12]. This, in part led to bioconstructivism, which looks at the ways in which nature has organised itself, such as the tessellation of pine cone ‘scales’ based on opposing helixes, and the ways in which broccoli florets arrange themselves according to the Fibonacci sequence. Emergence is a rigorous application of mathematics to these findings from nature, and a subsequent reapplication of those principles to other aspects of life, such as the development of artificial intelligence, or predicting stock market fluctuations. Until recently the term ‘emergence’ was generally used as a buzzword in architectural circles to refer to any seemingly complex system. Recently however, it has been steered onto the more stringent definition as “a system that cannot be deduced from its parts”[^13].

The most commonly cited example of the application of emergent design to architecture is termite mounds. Termite mounds have a complex system of tunnels that the termites use for their daily lives, but they are also used by the termites to carefully regulate the temperature of the whole mound by blocking and unblocking external openings, depending on the prevailing winds and the internal ambient temperature. There is no central control from the queen, and the termites themselves have no concept of the global situation, but as the termites are essentially identical, if one of them gets cold then it simply blocks up the nearest hole, and then unblocks it when it gets too warm. As the termites work to a very simple set of rules, and each of them has the same programming, the system runs efficiently.

Termites use an even simpler set of rules when building the mound in the first place.

<pre>Whilst wandering randomly
  If you find something
    then pick it up
      unless you’re already carrying something
        in which case drop it
</pre>
They change the environment and the changed environment modifies their behaviour[^14].

A termite finds a piece of wood and then caries it around until he finds another piece of wood, then he drops the piece and continues wandering around until he finds a third one and he repeats the process. As time passes many small mounds are produced which develop into fewer and fewer larger mounds until one mound will grow more than others. The larger mounds have a proportionally smaller surface area to volume ratios compared to the smaller mounds. Therefore, in the larger mounds, a greater proportion of the mound’s pieces are ‘protected’ from collection by being in the interior. As a result the larger mounds tend to grow and the smaller mounds to shrink until only one is left.

Emergent systems tend to be very complex, but the complexity is created by a large number of iterations of a very simple set of rules. The Spirograph sets that children use are a very simple example of this. The rules involved in the creation of the pattern are very simple, but the actual pattern created is much more complex.

The Emergence and Design Group is attached to the Emergent Technologies and Design masters program at the Architectural Association in London, and their work is essentially research based, trying to “produce a new research-based model of architectural enquiry”[^15], rather than the formal, or concept led design methods of recent years.

The Emergence and Design Group look to nature to find their rule sets. Evolution has had millennia of gradually evolving structural precedents, and due to the autonomous way in which cells function these natural structures grow according to very simple rules. For example plants lean towards the sun, thereby maximising the area of their leaves exposed for photosynthesis. They do this without any central processing unit, simply by using the turgescence of certain cells that are activated by the exposure, or lack thereof, to light[^16]. If these growth formulae can be determined then they can be extracted and reapplied. Once the group has sufficiently abstracted the rule set that governs the structure of interest, they apply it to an architectural form and use a computer program to grow and evolve a design.

The research that the Emergence and Design Group are doing uses computers to produce simulations of systems that would be inconceivably time consuming to calculate manually. The resultant insights taken from these simulations are allowing for new ways of conceiving structures, evolving architectural design into new areas
