In contrast to Gehry’s passive use of models his designs,<span class="small-caps">nox</span> use their models in an active way, by producing analogue computers and interrogating the model’s material properties to derive forms and strategies. The work of this Dutch practice is very much biased towards the design process, which gains as much media attention as the actual buildings themselves although for such a conceptual practice they have a surprising amount of built work.

The principle, Lars Spuybroek is Professor of Digital Design Techniques at the University and GhK of Kassel, a visiting Professor at Columbia University, Bartlett School of Architecture, Technical University Delft, and Other academic institutions throughout Europe.[^9] This academic involvement is evident in the way that the student research that Spuybroek supervises feeds back into the practice’s own work. For instance, the competition entry for the World Trade Centre replacement used techniques developed through his teaching in the USA and Germany[^10]. <span class="small-caps">nox</span> have always been interested in the way media, and specifically computing relates to architecture. Their early work in association with the V2 media lab in Rotterdam created installations for exhibitions worked on this interplay, mixing architectural forms with multimedia. Many of their buildings have a strong interactive element as well as unconventional built forms. Their H<sub>2</sub>O freshwater pavilion has both an unconventional form using a portal frame that morphs from a octagon to a rectangle in section, and contains a fully interactive interior with sounds, lights, projections and environmental variables (water sprays, mist etc.) all dependant on the movement and volume of visitors.

They are influenced by the structural forms of Frei Otto[^11] and Antonio Gaudí, and their design process is one of making a ‘machine’ that embodies the brief, using the machine, then working out the rules that govern it, writing an algorithm that describes those rules, and then using a computerised, and therefore more controllable version to produce a design. The machine isn’t a fixed item, but rather an object that needs to be designed according to each individual brief.

The machines generally take the form of an analogue computer; the entry for the World Trade Centre design was based on a machine that used hanging woollen threads. These threads were immersed in water and removed slowly,.The surface tension of the water and the cohesion effects produced by the wool’s surface finish caused the threads to stick together in places. <span class="small-caps">nox</span> then studied and replicated the rules that govern that process and use a digital computer to recreate the analogue computer in a more controlled way. Where the wet threads met defined open meeting spaces, nodes in the building. However the initial model produced too many of these to be commercially viable, so the digital model was used to reduce this to a viable number by telling the computer to run the simulation of the wool thread process many times, but only to display results with the required number of nodes.

If you accept that all natural phenomena are controlled by physics, then a set of rules, or physical principles can be established that describe any action witnessed. This allows the design to be reached much faster because the physics can be replicated in the computer so that the architect needn’t dip a thousand permutations of woollen threads to achieve the optimal design . The digital process can be repeated many thousands of times extremely quickly and will eventually produce a form which fulfils all the briefs requirements in addition the digitised version can be precisely controlled, whilst still retaining the essential qualities and the original concept of the design.

The main advantage of this approach using gravity as one of the main instigators in the analogue computing process, becomes apparent when considering that gravity is a major force in the real world, and so the forms derived from this analogue process will generally reconfigure themselves to take account for gravity making an efficient structure. Generally the forms generated from inverted hanging machines automatically do the engineering analysis, however at the scale nox’s models are generally built at, attractive and repellent forces such as surface tension and static electricity also have an effect, but the resultant form is configured to take all of these into account. The implications of material choice when constructing the analogue computing machine is that the “Materials, already informed, yield geometry as a consequence of their materiality”[^12] meaning that the nature of the material will affect it’s behaviour in the analogue calculating machine, so the decision to use 80gsm or 120gsm paper, or pvc, leather or wool threads in the design of the machine is important. Equally, the finished product will also be ‘material’ so the inferences drawn from structure can directly related.

The D Tower in Doetinchem in the Netherlands (1998- 2004) was designed using a combination process. The top was designed by deforming a sphere in an animation using an algorithm, and “At the point where the sphere, which starts out convex only, seems to have as much concave geometry as convex, [they] suspend the animation.”[^13] Once the top section was fixed a shopping bag analogy was used to design the legs. A mesh shopping bag reconfigures it’s arrangement depending on what is being carried at the time, the top of the D Tower was conceptualized as the shopping and the bag becomes the legs. This was inspired by the idea of using hanging chains to design parabolic arches and force diagrams, originally used by the Romans to design bridges and most famously by Gaudí to design the Sagrada Família. Traditionally floor planes are fixed horizontally, the model inverted, and strain gauges in static cords used to measure the tension and determine the diameter of each leg. However the top section of the D Tower is not inhabited so it’s orientation is unimportant, instead the legs diameters were fixed by using an elastic cord, and the top allowed to rotate to accommodate the forces. This is a simple but effective application of analogue computing.

As many of their projects have complex double curved forms, the methods used to cover them become more problematic. For Blowout (a public toilet in Neeltje Jans in the Netherlands, 1997) the skin was simply covered in mesh and sprayed with concrete, creating a homogenous surface. The more recent Son-O-House[^14] has a much more complicated skin of expanded mesh that is applied according to a set of rules given to the contractor. The rules govern the positioning and tessellation of a series of panels and the resulting surface has a pattern produced by the orientation of the cuts that produce the mesh and the resulting moiré effect is very interesting.

The <span class="small-caps">nox</span> approach embraces indeterminacy, their Iterative computational experiments yield unpredictable results and are pushing <span class="small-caps">nox</span> on to produce more and more innovative designs. The use of computers is very much evolutionary because even though they are repeating many of the experiments performed by Frei Otto, they are applying the computer in a way which takes them out of the realm of playful experiments and places them firmly into that of useful architectural tools. These approaches allow <span class="small-caps">nox</span> to control the overall design process, but the points at which they let go and allow the machines to take over creates unexpected and elegant solutions.
