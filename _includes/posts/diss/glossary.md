### Rapid prototyping
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/15/diss/rp-familia.png" alt="rp familia" />

Rapid prototyping is a general term applied to a range of manufacturing techniques used to produce a prototype of a computer model. The reason that rapid prototyping is used as opposed to more traditional manufacturing techniques is that there is no requirement for making jigs, or working out complicated tool paths. All the methods take very thin sections of the model and then rebuild them, so essentially they are stacked on top of each other.

### Selective Laser Sintering (sls)
<a href="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/steriolithography-2.png" rel="attachment wp-att-2013"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/15/diss/steriolithography-2.png" alt="steriolithography 2" /></a>

A very thin layer of fine polymer or metal particles is welded together using a laser beam in the pattern defined by a section through the computer model, the platform they are resting is then lowered by the thickness of the particle size, a new layer of particles is deposited and levelled off with a roller, and the process is repeated. When the particles melt they become connected to their neighbouring particles on the same layer and to those below them. sls can be used to produce fully dense working prototypes.

### Three Dimensional Physical Printing (3dpp)

An inkjet print head sprays a binder onto a powder layer that is arranged in the same way as in sls and glues the particles together layer by layer. The print head has several possible ink types and these can be configured to produce sections of the model that are soluble, thereby producing sacrificial supports etc.

### Laminated Object Modelling (lom)

Layers of self adhesive paper are rolled over the bed of the machine, and the outline is traced with a laser cutter, the remaining paper it then cut into a cross hatched pattern and can be broken off once the model is complete. This technique is relatively fast, but it is limited in its ability to produce models with interiors as the paper would be trapped inside, whereas with a powder based method one could make a cage with a ball loose inside as the powder would act as a support and hold the ball in suspension until completion when the model could be removed and shaken to remove the trapped dust.

### Stereolithography including Photomasking
<a href="/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/rp.png" rel="attachment wp-att-2014"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/15/diss/rp.png" alt="rp" /></a>

A polymer gel that is cured by exposure to light is contained in a tank similar to the ones used in powder based methods, the laser then tracks the shape required and the platen is lowered one layer and the process is repeated. The gel can produce objects in various colours including a clear resin[^24].  Photomasking uses the same system, but instead of the laser there is a large light covering the whole tank and a screen similar to the ones found in digital projectors that blocks the light where necessary.

### Fused deposition modelling (fdm)
This method is similar to curled pottery or making things with glue gun glue. The deposition head extrudes a thin bead of pvc in the outline of the shape, and also in a crosshatch pattern in the interior for support, lowers the platen, and continues. As there is no powder or liquid to support the form as it is grown there is a secondary head which deposits a water soluble material that acts as a sprue.

### Computer model
A computer model can take various forms; it can be purely mathematical, for example, the prediction of stock market trends, or the predictions of cod populations. In architectural terms however, the computer model is generally a representation in three dimensional virtual space of the intended form of the proposed structure. This can then have various physics calculations and geometrical transformations applied to it in order to achieve a structurally optimised or formally interesting design. The computer model can also be used to dramatically reduce design lead times and construction wastage by producing precise bills of quantities and doing, for instance, all the steelwork detailing, or automatically analysing egress routes for fire regulations. As the computer model is software based it can be passed around different specialists in its ‘soft’ form and they can modify the design reducing time consuming draughting. The building can be essentially perfect before it is committed to production.

### Spline
<img class="wp-image-2018 alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/15/diss/dissertation_Page_69.jpg" alt="dissertation_Page_69" >

Splines are the most common method of defining curves in computer graphics. They were originally a thin piece of wood with weights attached to control the curves and were used in ship building to define the hull shapes. The weights have been replaced with control points which do the same thing in a computerised environment.

### Topology
Put simply topology is a branch of geometry that isn’t concerned with scales or directions, but more with how things are connected together and if they have holes in them. A torus is a topological object because if scaled to an infinitely small scale the torus would always be bigger than the hole, and as such the torus would never disappear whereas a ball could continue to be scaled until it disappeared. The most commonly cited topological transformation is from a donut to a tea cup, as the donut already has a hole in it, it is simply a case of moving the matter around the hole to change the form. One side of the hole gets very thin and becomes the handle and the other side becomes much larger and gets a dent in the top and becomes the bowl. The donut and the cup are topologically identical[^25].

### Möbius strip
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/15/diss/mobius.png" alt="mobius" />

The Möbius strip is a mathematical curiosity in that it is a topological surface with only one side. Discovered in the nineteenth century by August Ferdinand Möbius. It is often explained using a paper strip which has been given a half twist and stuck end to end in a loop. This description can lead to confusion when trying to conceptualise it later on as the paper strip is a thin three dimensional object, it has sides and is essentially a flattened torus, whereas the Möbius strip is actually a two dimensional object that exists in three dimensional space.

### Klein Bottle
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/15/diss/klein31.png" >

In 1882 Felix Klein devised a Möbius strip with an extra dimension, a Möbius surface essentially, this was eventually called a Klein Bottle. In contrast to the paper approximation of the Möbius strip provides great surprise and delight in those who encounter it, the Klein bottle is quite disappointing, the point where the surface intersects itself makes the three dimensional form seem not to work,  however if you consider the Möbius strip to be a two
dimensional surface that needs to exist in three dimensional space the Klein Bottle is a two dimensional surface that needs to exist in four dimensional space to work. The Möbius strip does it’s flip in the third dimension, allowing it’s special properties, and the Klein Bottle avoids it’s intersection in the fourth dimension37.

### Virtual space

The way in which we conceptualise space is based on the relationship between the objects that surround us. In looking at a photograph or a painting we are constructing virtual space in our heads because we feel immersed in the medial experience, but it is really just a planar image. However the general use of the term is to describe a geometrically constructed ‘space’ created inside a computer. The advantage of computerised virtual space is that it has no limits, and can be made to be as multi dimensional as required, and scales aren’t a barrier to conception. A virtual space can also follow any geometrical rules desired, in the same way that Alice encountered unconventional space as she stepped through the looking glass , virtual space can allow us to experience, and the subsequently design in and inhabit another realm


### Non-Euclidean geometry
Euclid of Alexandria (Greek: Eukleides) (circa 365–275 BC)38 wrote a book called ‘Elements’ in which he lays out his famous postulates, upon which all geometry was based until the first half of the nineteenth century when the fifth postulate was finally successfully challenged. Two dimensional Euclidean geometry is geometry on a flat plane, and all the postulates are true, but if the plane is hyperbolic then several of the postulates fail. The most commonly used example is of parallel lines, on a plane two parallel lines never meet, but, if two lines are parallel at the equator of a sphere then they will touch at the poles. In the curved plane these lines are still straight.39

### Digital
Digitally encoded information is a stream of 1 and 0 (i.e. base 2) and various combinations of these mean different things. Virtually all electronic computers use binary systems. The disadvantage of digital information is that it is made up of discreet chunks, so it will measure in steps and interpolate the gaps.

### Analogue
A system that has no graduations, and can therefore give an infinitely variable response. Data that is recorded in an analogue form is generally stored as a wave form, for example a record player reads analogue information off the records surface. A bent piece of paper is an analogue system because the paper can achieve an infinite number of forms with no steps in between

### Computing
Computing is a mathematical or logical calculation; a task is computable if one can specify a sequence of instructions, a rule set, which when followed will result in the completion of the task. This set of instructions is called an effective procedure, or algorithm, and is what is fed into a computer as a program.

### Computer
Generally a computer is conceived as a machine which takes an algorithm and applies it to a set of data, they are generally digital these days, but Charles Babbage’s difference engine is one of the first examples of a mathematical computer40. In an analogue computer however the algorithm is intrinsic to the materiality of the object, and the calculation is carried out by the interaction of forces and the device itself to give results. Analogue computers are generally used to calculate complicated catenary curves and three dimensional surfaces.

### Iteration
A process of constant refinement to discover a result. Similar to filing a peg to fit in a hole, but in a mathematical way. An equation will roughly calculate a figure, then it will recalculate it using the error or variation to hone the result, therefore tending towards perfect.

### Blob
An amorphous three dimensional shape generally associated with early digital architecture, also called isosurfaces

### cad
computer aided design, a fairly generic term for any computer process that is used in design, but it generally refers to the use of a program such as AutoCAD for making drawings.

### caad
computer aided architectural design. Features such as greater automation of laborious tasks such as producing bills of quantities, and the addition of symbol libraries of conventional architectural objects (doors, walls, windows) make the production of conventional architectural designs very quick.

### cam
computer aided manufacture, any manufacturing procedure that is aided by a computer, this could range from very simple computer controlled lathe paths to controlling a laser sinter station.

### catia
a computer program produced by a French company called Dassault Systemes, it was initially used to design fighter jets because of its advanced handling of curved surfaces. It’s real power lies in it’s massive capacity for customisation, there are now plug-ins for virtually all industry sectors allowing designers to sculpt organic forms for packaging design, or exact fuselage shapes for fighter jets, then make virtual assemblies of components, analyse stresses, design fabrication methods, mould shapes and ribs, etc. The possibilities of it are huge, the only thing holding it back is it’s prohibitive price, an average set up cost for one workstation is at least £20 000.

### cnc
<figure>

</figure>

computer numerical control. Computer controlled manufacturing machines are described as cnc machines because a set of numerical instructions describes the tool paths. Initially these were set out on punch cards, but these days they are all digital. The most useful machines as far as architectural applications are concerned are five axis milling machines, these have three linear axis – two horizontal, and one vertical, and two rotational axis or planes. This allows the head to rotate to present different parts of the tool to the surface, which allows for complex geometry, and faster runs as the job needs fewer clamping changes and the tool head can be moved out of the way if necessary.

### Finite element analysis - fea
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/15/diss/ansys-d-tower.jpg" alt="ansys d tower" />

This is a method of calculating the effects of a physical intervention (stress, heat, etc.) on an object. Invented in 1943[^26] it was used for very limited analysis of deformations, it essentially involves breaking the object into sections, finite elements. Then by using a very complex matrix and even more complex series of calculations on that matrix the interaction between the elements is established. fea was invented before the advent of digital computers, didn’t really take off until the advent of super computers due to the huge calculations involved in producing results. The main fea program these days is ansys[^27], this was used to calculate the structure and apply forces such as wind loading to the <span class="small-caps">nox</span> D-Tower.

### Morphing
<img class="wp-image-2027 alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/15/diss/darcy.png" alt="darcy" >

A procedure that first gained fame in the 1991 film Terminator 2–Judgement Day[^28] as the metal terminator turned into a pool of molten metal and then back into a humanoid robot. First described by D’arcy Thompson in his 1918 book ‘on growth and form’ where he demonstrated the evolutionary lineage of skeletal parts by distorting a grid over them, and then continuing the distortion to predict the next step.

### Parametric design
method of design where the dimensions of an object are defined, not as an absolute numerical value, but in relation to another value, for instance a rectangle where the one side is x and the other is 2x. As parameters can be fixed or limited parametric algorithms can be linked to configurations and used to mass-customise items such as running shoes[^29] or even houses[^30].

### Artificial intelligence
a general name applied to a system that displays signs of sentient thought. There are various ways of achieving artificial intelligence, but the general principle is that it is based on a bottom up approach in that the system is given a very set of rules, and it is then left to learn.

### Rendering
a computer process that calculates how the objects in a scene interact with light, and then produces a realistic image of the scene. The objects are assigned material properties that define how the light will interact with them, and the resulting calculations take into account all these factors to produce the image.

### vr
virtual reality is an attempt to create a simulated immersion in an environment. The Victorians produced stereoscopic images by taking two images from marginally different viewpoints, and the using a special viewer showed one to each eye, therefore fooling the viewers optical system into thinking it was seeing a three dimensional scene due to an illusion of binocular vision. This principle has been taken on much further, and now the photographs can be replaced by moving images, and these can be linked to a scene that can be navigated around at will. The main constraint in the immersive experience is that only two senses are engaged (sound and vision), and in order to engage the other three is still beyond our capabilities.

### Vector
a vector contains magnitude (size – speed, length etc.) and direction, so it can describe movement, or a line. Vector graphics is made up of a series of lines which are defined mathematically rather than being described by a series of pixels.

### Turing machine
<img class="size-full wp-image-2026 alignright" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/15/diss/turing.png" alt="turing" />

Alan Turing was a mathematician who worked with the British army to crack the German Enigma code during the Second World War. He designed the first digital computers and used them in code breaking. A Turing machine isn’t actually a physical object, but rather a mathematical concept that describes the series of events that would happen in a notional computer to compute a problem[^31].

### Scan
to scan something generally means to digitise it’s coordinate data, if it is a two dimensional object then the scanner will measure the colour of a set number of points (the number being defined by the resolution i.e. 600 dots per inch, so it will scan 600 points per linear inch) and then reconstruct the data into an image in the computer. If the object is three dimensional then the scanner will measure its form by using either a touch probe which measures the object by touching it, or with lasers, and sometimes also its colour. The date is then reconstructed as a point cloud in the computer and a surface which corresponds to those points is generated.

### Hyper[cube]

understanding four dimensional concepts is easier if you start with lower dimensions and extrapolate. If you start with a point, a zero dimensional object, and add a dimension, you must add a point for every existing point, you get a line, a one dimensional object. This line is a hyperpoint. Then if you add another dimension to make the line two dimensional then you have a square plane, a hyperline. In adding another dimension to make a three dimensional cube you have created a hypersquare. These terms seem a little ridiculous when applied to objects which we already have names for because we are all familiar with them, but when we add another dimension to a cube we get a hypercube, which we cannot visualise because we do not have the apparatus to do so, but it has captured the imagination of many artists and mathematicians. Dali’s Corpus Hypercubus is a prime example, it shows one of the possible ‘unfoldings’ of a hypercube, but as the human visual system is only equipped to deal with two dimensional images, a perspective of a three dimensional object can be projected onto a two dimensional plane, but a four dimensional object is more difficult.

The same principle can be applied to any shape to produce hyper-pentagons or hyper-spheres, and as such any three dimensional solid can be considered the hyper surface of a four dimensional object.

### Meta
meta is a prefix that denotes a level of transcendence, for example in a cube the vertices that extend in the third dimensional are meta points. It can be simplified to ‘about’, meta data is data about data (98% of all statistics are made up)

### Maya
Maya is Alias Wavefront’s[^32] three dimensional animation and modelling product. It was one of the first programs to include a cloth simulator, and has been used to model tensile structures because of this. It also has a programming language which is widely used to create design algorithms called mel (Maya Embedded Language) it’s use is so widespread due to it’s relative ease of use[^33].

### 3D Studio Max
3D Studio Max, or Max as it’s commonly called is made by discreet[^34], a subsidiary of AutoDesk[^35] (who make AutoCAD) but they try and distance themselves as much as possible from their parent company. The program is used a lot in three dimensional graphics for films, and recent versions have been boosting its architectural visualisation abilities with ready made components. It has a built in programming language called Max Script, but it is relatively hard to learn, and as such hasn’t found as much favour as other scripting languages (mel for example). It also has a range of dynamics tools which can simulate cloth and mechanical assemblies.

### Asymptote
A curve which continually tends towards an axis, and becomes infinitesimally close but never actually reaches it.

### gc
Generative components is Bentley Systems new parametric design software application. It is very powerful and allows designs to be reached by inputting constraints and sets of logical rules. It will produce structural drawings directly from the design model, and as the model is updated so are the construction drawings. This allows lead times to be significantly reduced, and allows the moment when the design must be ‘frozen’ to be much later
