# The Smart Geometry Group
## Lars Hesselgren (KPF), Robert Aish (Bentley), Hugh Whitehead (Foster and Partners), J Parrish (Arup Sports).

The smart geometry group is a fairly loose collection of people all working at a very high level in parametric computer modelling. They are generally concerned with educating the new generation of architects in methods of parametric design, and also pushing the envelope of parametric design itself. They work predominantly with a new software package that is as yet unreleased, called ‘generative components’ which is made by Bentley Systems (makers of Microstation22), who also sponsor the group.

The program allows some very simple rules to be set up to produce much more complicated geometry. By manipulating the inputs to those rule algorithms, one set of rules can be used in a great number of situations to produce significantly differing results. J Parrish has been designing parametrically ever since programmable calculators were released when he codified an algorithm for working out the pitch of stadium seating banks. Since then he has been working for Arup Sport designing sports stadia including the Cardiff millennium stadium and the stadium for the 2008 Beijing Olympics with Herzog & De Meuron. The parametric nature of the design method allows him to design, in his own words, “a significant amount of a stadium whilst waiting in an airport.”23 Realistically this means that because much of the hard work in figuring out the details of the design is calculated by the algorithms in a few minutes, rather than a month as it would be if it was being done manually, many more iterations of a design can be produced. In turn this means that it is financially viable to test all the possible options rather than picking the first one and hoping it will be the best. Initially the parametric algorithms were limited to designing the sightlines for seating arrangements, but they have now become very advanced, and now include egress, concessions, structure, circulation, roof structure, etc. Arup Sport can now have an entire stadium designed, modelled and even animated in three days. Parrish’s real ‘dream’ is to design a stadium in one day, and then be able to design another the next.

The Beijing stadium has a complex ‘bird’s nest’ structural arrangement, and to detail the connections for each of the intersections, and to make sure that the network actually functions efficiently structurally, parametric design was employed. They used catia to design, to a certain extent, the bird’s nest’s actual configuration once it’s overall form was set by the seating arrangement in the bowl (which was itself set parametrically). catia interrogated each member  and then outputted the exact detailing for the contractor to bend cut and drill the relevant parts.

The new proposed development for Kowloon’s waterfront uses gc (generative components) extensively, both in designing the form, and also in detailing it so that it actually works. The huge level of highly controlled automation allowed Foster & Partners to produce a virtually finished competition entry on a very quick time scale. Once the concept had been formulated gc was used to design the actual form and the construction detailing. The program allowed the designers to pull the design around as if it was a malleable physical model using it’s parameters giving a much greater degree of design resolution than would otherwise be possible.

The group has been running a number of seminars and workshops over the last 2 years to introduce some of the industries top designers and also some students to the possibilities offered by the beta version of gc. They assert that, with gc one is modelling a set of relationships between points, lines and planes rather than geometry, and the geometry is almost incidental. Ironically mathematicians in some fields see this as quite an accurate definition of geometry.

The methods of producing architectural design researched by the Smart Geometry Group are not only allowing for the automation of the menial and time consuming, but also for the design to work in tandem with the structure. This thereby brings the architect and the engineer back into dialogue throughout the process and allows designs to become more innovative and interesting with elegance an inherent part of their design, rather than creating a battle between architect and engineer to get the desired result.

The Smart Geometry Group’s use of parametric algorithms to enable and accelerate design is probably the theoretical research most likely to become mainstream. Within the next ten years the concept of architect as tool builder will become a reality simply because of commercial pressures. Their techniques can allow designers to produce mediocre designs quickly by using ready made tools. However the true future of the software will be in the opportunities for using the tool building process as a design task in itself.
