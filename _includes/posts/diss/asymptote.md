<p class="inter-paragraph">Novak’s work continues to explore the boundaries of what digital technologies make possible, the inhabitation of virtual space is now a significant issue in architectural discourse.

<h1 id="asymptote">Asymptote - Hani Rashid &amp; Lise Anne Couture</h1>

Asymptote are involved in exploring the boundary between real and virtual space, their work either straddles this boundary, or remains entirely in the virtual domain. Hani Rashid and Lise Anne Couture have been pushing the boundaries of what can conventionally be called architecture for the last nine years. They courted major media controversy for their New York Stock Exchange Virtual Trading Floor (<span class="small-caps">nyse 3dtf</span>). The <span class="small-caps">nyse 3dtf</span> was a virtual environment for trading stocks, but the question of whether or not a space created inside a computer, that cannot be physically inhabited, could be deemed architecture whilst still inside the intangible realm of virtual space was fiercely contested.

Ever since William Gibson invented cyberspace in his 1984 book Neuromancer[^27], people have been discussing ways of inhabiting this space. In cyberspace the traditional constraint of physics no longer control one’s actions and it is genuinely three dimensional (rather than the two and a bit that we inhabit in everyday life due to the way our physiology constrains us to resting on, or briefly above, a horizontal plane), virtual objects can be positioned at any point. In virtual space time isn’t a factor as it is in real space, because the computers clock can be turned to run backwards or even stop if required.

Asymptote have tried to formalise how people would interact with a 3D virtual space construct without a priori knowledge of how to operate in completely free space. In the <span class="small-caps">nyse 3dtf</span>[^28] the final design has a plane defining the lowest point visible, easily recognisable as a floor, which gives users a datum plane to orient themselves. However, as normal physics does not apply, in order to display greater detail, or to view two pieces of information that are not initially together - such as stock prices and news reports or demographic data overlaid onto share trends - they have used temporal displacements and distortions to allow initially disparate parts of the space to be viewed together. This is essentially a simulation of real space (with a floor and walls) but taking advantage of some of the opportunities offered by the computerised environment to create a more legible data structure. The fact that the floor plane is deemed necessary shows the early stage which virtual environments were at when it was designed, and it seemed necessary to approximate an easily recognisable architectural  interior in order for it to be deemed architecture rather than simply a graphical user interface (gui). The temporal distortions are the first excursion into the different properties of this alien space, but in general the environment is reasonably constrained to conventional inhabitation norms. In light of the success of the <span class="small-caps">nyse 3dtf</span> they were commissioned to refit the physical <span class="small-caps">nyse</span> building, in response they fitted a vast array of data screens and access points to the <span class="small-caps">3dtf</span> in order to bring the virtual into the real space. The <span class="small-caps">3dtf</span> can be seen as an augmentation to the real trading floor, or, as is being seen more and more with the rise of internet commerce the real floor is seen as a physical representation of the <span class="small-caps">3dtf</span>.

Another example of this technique is the Virtual Guggenheim Museum where even the constraint of a horizontal datum was removed, and the viewer (operator, user, inhabitant) is free to move and rotate 360° in any plane in order to view the virtual and internet art ‘objects’. This project shows how Asymptote, and general attitudes to the inhabitation of virtual space, have moved on, in that one is no longer constrained by virtual gravity or virtual inertia. The Virtual Guggenheim was conceived as a native environment to experience artwork for which the intended means of display and distribution is the internet. The concept of a computerised three dimensional space is difficult, as virtually all computer screens are viewed in two dimensions, but even in life we see a perspective or other projection of a three dimensional object displayed on a two dimensional plane. The eye has only a two dimensional plane onto which light from real three dimensional objects is projected and the brain is confused into believing in the medial immersion. This allows virtual space to be believable rather than simply being a gui. This project enables the difference between virtual building and virtual architecture to be defined, where a virtual building is a computerised visualisation of an existing or un-built building, whereas virtual architecture is an virtually conceived and defined space that takes advantage of the removal of the special and physical constraints, whilst being mindful of the limitations in the number of senses engaged whilst experiencing it. The concept of the site as a space or area that defines where people can experience the architecture is stretched when the influence of the internet is considered. In this case, if the architecture has a virtual component, then immersion and experience is extended to anywhere that can access the internet. In the Fluxspace 2.029 installation at the 2000 Venice Biennale (where Asymptote contributed to the usa pavilion along side Greg Lynn) there are a pair of opposing fish-eye digital cameras which take a picture every 30 seconds, and the large revolving mirrors ensured that the photos were never the same. This is a fairly basic method of integrating virtual and real space, but with the advances in technology and architectural thought, more considerable interaction is likely in the future.

Asymptote’s work integrates the computer into the architecture, and sometimes the architecture into the computer, allowing the two to exist side by side and interact. Their method of work is bound to become more widespread as clients demand buildings that can interact with the ‘information age’. Also as people begin to appreciate the possibilities for inhabiting the internet rather than just viewing it, defining the spatial characteristics of cyberspace will become a pressing issue.
