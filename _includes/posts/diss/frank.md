<h1 id="frank">Frank Gehry</h1>
Frank Gehry was the first architect to utilise the processing power of computers in the production of built architecture. The resultant constructions have inspired the recent generation of architects to look beyond the familiar rectilinear and experiment with unconventional forms.

The iconic building is the Gehry trademark. Buildings like the Disney music hall in Los Angeles, the Bilbao Guggenheim museum and the bridge Gehry has contributed to Millennium Square in Chicago are all icons in their own right, a city accessory, and an extension of the Gehry brand. In the same way the latest handbag is an indicator of the wearer’s wealth, good taste and willingness to invest in the best for themselves, a Gehry building gives the same kudos to a city, and in an attempt to boost the cities image and media exposure and therefore tourism and economy many are commissioning their own icons. Several large cities have hoped to boost their economies using the so called ‘Bilbao effect’ to promote archi-tourism, and to give their city a presence in the world’s media. For instance Toronto has directly attributed a 2.3% rise in tourism to the new Will Alsop Sharp Centre for Design[^5]. The Gehry brand uses large curving shapes and shiny metal skins, to create buildings more akin to giant sculptures or pseudo futuristic space stations than conventional buildings. The futuristic forms imply a futuristic design method. However for the most part computer technologies actually play only a small part in the design of these buildings and are only really brought into play once a physical model is built that the designers are happy with. As such the computer becomes more of a realisation tool than a design tool. The computer has little or no input into the design of the form[^6].

The current signature Gehry style had its inception with the fish sculpture on the Barcelona seafront commissioned for the 1992 Olympics. The design process involved in the sculptural composition of the fish sculpture began with the design and construction of a physical model using the traditional architectural techniques of paper modelling, a simple sheet of paper was bent and pushed until a desirable form was acquired. No computers were used at this stage. The initial model was scanned using a touch probe scanner, and then recreated in digital space using <span class="small-caps">catia</span> to allow it to be cut up and made into component drawings. At the time this was revolutionary, and the use of computers to create non standard forms seemed very exciting. In an interview with Dassault Systemes, Gehry’s chief partner Jim Glymph said: “The use of <span class="small-caps">catia</span> on our projects has extended the possibilities in design far beyond what we believed was possible ten years ago. We hope that within the next ten years this technology will be available for all architects and engineers,”[^7]

However what Gehry’s computers produce, in essence, isn’t anything new. They merely facilitate the expansion and extension of an existing process making the extended version financially viable by speeding it up. By using a computer to scan a shape that had already been designed and physically modelled, the complex drawings and calculations could be automated whereas the calculations and accuracy of specification for the metal work contractor would have proved too complicated and time consuming to be done manually, given it’s size and latticed copper construction. In essence the use of computers in the design of the sculpture was one borne out of necessity because the calculations and subsequent drawings and specifications necessary to make and support a physically viable structure, without the use of the vast number crunching ability available in a computer was hugely time consuming and not possible to acceptable levels of accuracy. Once programmed with sufficient physics information a computer is a far more reliable engineer than a human because they can employ finite element analysis and other necessary calculations far more rigorously and the drawings produced by computers are more accurate. The real benefit of computer draughting is where there are no drawings at all produced and the computer communicates directly with the manufacturing device (be that a multi axis mill, a laser cutter or a rapid prototyping machine). <span class="small-caps">catia</span> is a particularly powerful program that can do this, borrowed from the aeronautical industry where it is used to design fighter jets. It has a vast range of plug-in accessory modules that allow it to be tailored to one’s needs.8 Gehry uses <span class="small-caps">catia</span> to design and specify all the underlying structural componentry required to support the buildings.

Gehry’s computing techniques were ground breaking at the time, and something that had never been done before. They opened up a host of new possibilities in architecture and the possible architectural forms available to architects to use beyond modifications of the traditional cuboidal shape. These possibilities were extremely exciting for the architectural community and allowed architecture to take its place amongst the physical art forms and made buildings as sculpture possible, extending their value beyond that of practical purposes as shelter. Many of Gehry’s subsequent buildings have used the same technique, and as a result look very similar to the Bilbao Guggenheim, for example the Walt Disney Concert Hall and the Experience Music Project . More recent building projects have used the power of <span class="small-caps">catia</span> to a certain extent, but this is generally in automating the insertion of windows or the specification of steelwork. The Der Neue Zollhof office buildings (1999) are a good example of the more recent Gehry work flow. The form was realised as a physical model, scanned, and then the structure was added as an afterthought and the windows were inserted using a <span class="small-caps">catia</span> subroutine that oriented them towards the most pleasing views. The structural data was the outputted to cnc mills that made the polystyrene moulds for the concrete skin and the steel work data outputted to the contractor.

The evolution of the Gehry design technique seems to have stopped soon after the introduction of <span class="small-caps">catia</span>, all his subsequent buildings have used the design, model, scan, support technique. However the inherent human aspect involved in the model creation and the non-involvement of the computer in the design process leads to structurally inefficient buildings which require massively more structure than an equivalent rectilinear building. Most famously the Bilbao Guggenheim museum which looks spectacular from outside, and has had an enormous impact on the economy of Bilbao, but inside is a confused mass of steelwork which contorts itself wildly in order to support the museum’s complex shell.

The design process used by the Gehry office is merely the hand draughting and engineering process speeded up by using computers, the structural data which is generated by <span class="small-caps">catia</span> and ansys is not used to modify the form or design, but merely to specify the structure. It is essentially computer aided drawing, as it was at the dawn of Autocad, or even computer aided sculpture, but the computer is, essentially, left out of the design process.

The Gehry style is essentially a computerisation of the ancient technique of doing a scalar transformation of a three dimensional shape such as that used in Renaissance sculpture. Starting with a small object he makes it a big object. The computer is left out of the design procedure completely, and as such following the Gehry method of design, while not a regressive step is certainly not a step forward.

<p class="inter-paragraph">Frank Gehry’s passive physical modelling can be seen as an early step towards the integration of physical and digital forms. The physical form allows the designer to see exactly what the end product will be, but it leaves no room to allow the computer to do any iterative structural correction or interpretation. Simple physical models have been used for centuries to define forms too complex to model mathematically, but with computers these models can be digitised and modified in digital space, a feature Gehry has not taken advantage of. The exciting prospect now is designing the active physical model or ‘machine’ and then to digitise this to allow further evolution of the design to take place.</p>
