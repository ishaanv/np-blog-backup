[^1]: In 1965 Gordon Moore predicted that the number of transistors per integrated circuit would double every 2 years. This has remained true ever since, however we are reaching the limits of our current manufacturing techniques capacity, but this has happened before and a new technology has allowed the trend to continue unabated.

[^2]: Manual de Landa describes the progression of history in European culture as mineralization, whereby towns which would originally have been built and defended with wooden structures became more and more dependant on their architecture as means of defence.
