This text will explore the use of computers in the design process, their move up the hierarchy of design tools, and what their new position higher up that hierarchy is making possible in terms of exotic form finding. Instead of merely producing purely sculptural forms, new computing technologies allow structural considerations to work symbiotically to produce true elegance in the architecture they produce when wielded by today’s architects.

The exponentially increasing processing speed of computers[^1], and the resultant advances in software and modelling techniques is allowing situations to be modelled in increasing complexity. It also enables designers to have more freedom in what they choose to represent, with fewer of the constraints of primitive computer technology. It is therefore important to understand how this new technology is affecting architectural design today because greater comprehension allows more imaginative use of these technologies.

Technology has always informed architectural design, and large technological advances have inevitably informed changes in architectural styles. Traditionally, from pre-history through to the classical and medieval periods, architecture was one of the major driving forces behind technology because it was a significant part of the war machinery of any state. Fortified towns, castles and other military buildings were as much a part of an arms race[^2] as trebuchets and cannons. As the battles became more high-tech, and the advent of gunpowder made traditional stone fortifications obsolete, other parts of society quickly took over as the driving force behind technological advances. Since then, transport (land, water and air transport) and later information (its collection and dissemination) have been the main impetus behind technological advancement, with other players such as agriculture industry and medicine also contributing, as architecture fell further and further from the cutting edge. Over the last few centuries technologies from other disciplines have cross pollinated into architecture and the prevailing paradigm has changed from one where architecture is a technological innovator to one where architecture is technologically bankrupt, scavenging the innovations that have fallen away from the cutting edge of other industries and trying to integrate them, usually inappropriately, into a ‘style’.

During the last few decades, computers have come to the fore in every field and are utilised in virtually every aspect of modern life, including architecture. However, computing is not just the digital work performed by computers but a general term meaning calculated that can include the complicated analogue calculations found in nature. Calculation is a process that needs to follow a set of rules, but this rule set can be anything from simple arithmetic to the complex non-standard systems found in nature. The arrangement of sand ridges caused by a receding tide on a beach is as much a product of computation as a cad rendering or the output from a spreadsheet.

Analogue calculations have long been used by designers wishing to simulate real world phenomena for example the catenary[^3] curves to arch force models used by Gaudí to compute the forces in the complex arches and columns in the Sagrada Família. However, it has taken time to bring about a unification between the number crunching abilities of a digital computer and these analogue calculations already involved in architectural design. The first digital computers were invented by Alan Turing[^4] to crack the complex enigma code, and early applications were all in the fields of mathematics or engineering because of their huge number crunching abilities in comparison to human mathematicians. Similarly the computer, as applied to architectural design, was to begin with simply a replacement or augmentation of the draughting already undertaken by hand on paper. The computer produced a collection of virtual two dimensional lines on a virtual two dimensional plane, with the express purpose of plotting onto paper using computer controlled mechanical arm with a traditional pen attached to it. It was a device designed specifically to mimic human action, even down to the details of the printing process.

Recently, in a series of evolutionary steps the digital computing process has gained considerable complexity through integration with technologies from other disciplines (engineering analysis, cinema special effects, physics simulation). The original two dimensional virtual space became three dimensional virtual space, and has now become <span class="small-caps">n</span>-dimensional virtual space, and the crude two dimensional plotting has become photo quality printing, and has even migrated into three dimensions with rapid prototyping and <span class="small-caps">cnc</span> machining. Moreover, although these technologies have only become commercially viable recently they have been researched extensively for some time so there are considerable advances already waiting on the sidelines to be integrated into real design projects.

The area in which the biggest advances have been made is that involved in understanding how the design, as opposed to pure mechanised draughting, can been enabled through software. For example, techniques and software from the cinema special effects industry have been used to generate forms with animated morphing, and virtual clay sculpting, borrowed from the automotive styling industry, has allowed styling and physics to be considered simultaneously. Complex physical models were used by Frei Otto and Ted Happold as analogue computers to develop minimal structures. By using the material properties of the model the complex analysis was largely done already and subsequent computer analysis of the resultant structures has shown this to be a very effective technique

In particular, iterative design techniques based on analysis of naturally occurring emergent systems have begun to be used at the very forefront of architectural design. The elegance derived from emergent systems is both beautiful and efficient, but to model them in digital space requires both immense processing power and also an intricate knowledge of the rule set governing the system being modelled, a use closer to the early engineering and mathematical applications of the early computers than to digital draughting. The modelling of very complex systems highlights the main difference between digital and analogue computing: anomalous results from a process in an analogue computer are generally due to a rogue variable, unconsidered due to too much complexity (e.g. neglecting the effect of Reynolds number in the miniaturization of airflow tests, or forgetting that the sun would warm one side of the model more than the other when testing a structure), whereas the opposite is true in digital computers where the lack of complexity is usually responsible for misleading results (e.g. neglecting to include an algorithm that includes joint friction in loading situations.)

It is possible to design an algorithm that will do just about anything, for instance designing a form based on the flow of people through a space, but more commonly people will modify a commercially available program with advanced modelling algorithms already built in. Cloth simulators, borrowed from cinema special effects, are one possible way of developing forms as UN Studio did at Anaheim Central Station. The results of these algorithms are interpreted as three dimensional models in programs like 3DStudio Max or Maya. Form finding exercises are only limited by the controller’s imagination, talent and ingenuity.

The design process now has an element of chaos introduced into it, a designer can design a machine or system for generating a result, and then, if the system is digitised and reduced to an algorithm, it can be allowed to run hundreds or thousands of times until an acceptable design is produced. In other words, results with certain characteristics, to use Darwinian terms, ‘fitness’, can be selected which can then be interbred to produce ‘offspring’ which are more desirable; generating an iterative process, the results of which tend towards a perfect design.

Parameters in a real system are all connected, even the very basic example of a simply supported beam relies on a large set of variables when it is examined; length, breadth, depth, cross sectional shape, material, manufacturing technique, surface finish, ambient temperature, and a host of others. These parameters all affect the beams load bearing capacity, and a change to any of them will affect the extent to which the others impact on performance. Parametric design then becomes very interesting. J Parish from Arup sport is planning to design a parametric design algorithm that will allow him to design an entire sports stadium in a day with all the considerations, from servicing to sight lines covered. The interesting thing is that the program won’t just design one stadium, but the ideal stadium given all the input considerations.

The question at this point in architectural history is one of uptake. Will the design community at large grasp the possibilities offered to make designs fitted exactly to the site, user and program, or will they be transfixed by the cheerful shapes and not look beyond and see the possibilities?

There are a number architects who have made significant contributions to architectural design in this field. This text seeks to explore advances in the field through the study of a number of prominent practitioners and the ways in which they have employed computer technology in the inception of their designs.
