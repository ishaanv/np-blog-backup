<p class="inter-paragraph">The most significant creation of the information revolution has been the birth of the internet. As modern life becomes increasingly dependant on the interactive interfaces, and the vast wealth of the information stored within, the way that we interact with computers becomes a concern. Do we look at them or do we inhabit them?</p>

<h1 id="novak">Marcus Novak</h1>

Novak has been involved in researching and conceptualising the use of computers in architecture since the late seventies. He has held various positions at American universities researching the architectural implications of digital technologies, and has been at the forefront of the research into virtually all the computer technologies that are applicable to architecture today.

Imbued with a classical Greek education Novak was fascinated from an early age with geometry, music, art, logic etc. He eventually settled on becoming an architect and struggled to reconcile his interests with his chosen profession, urged by many to discard some of them to focus on others. Refusing to do so he attempted to make an architecture that encompassed them all.

As much of Novak’s work is purely research based it allows itself to push the boundaries of what is considered architecture into art, computer graphics and mathematics. He stresses the importance of being “intellectually multilingual”[^17], as are an increasing number of architects who are pushing the boundaries of what the computer makes possible. The ability to speak the languages of other disciplines is allowing the conceptual and technical advancement of those disciplines to enrich architecture.

Generative composition has been an accepted practice for a long time in music and Brian Eno’s Koan[^18] project was the first to bring it to the mass stage. Novak took these algorithms that generated musical compositions and modified them to work on spatial dimensions. His theory of ‘liquid architecture’ is based on the way music is formalised. The parametric nature of the classical orders inspired a way of thinking about architecture as a set of parameters that was lost on most people at the time, but has come to be one of the most important concepts in modern computerised architectural design. He attempted to create computer code that would recognise beauty, long considered a dirty word in intellectual circles due to the illusive nature of a rigorous definition. He used an amalgamation of several previous methods taken from different fields[^19]orms were indeed beautiful and elegant, but did contain objects floating in space and other such unbuildable forms.

Through his teaching and research, Novak discovered that the early tools designed for a generic designer were inappropriate for most applications because most designers were working in non-generic situations. He started making his own tools and integrating computers into his teaching at Ohio State University five years before Bernard Tschumi set up the ‘paperless studio’ at Columbia. His theory was that if architectural form could be freed from the economic restraints that it is currently tied with by using these ‘tools’ then form would become regulated by human preference.

simulated binocular vision and the head movement based navigation system removed the degree of dislocation associated with the ability to look beyond the two dimensional screen and from using hands to move the field of vision. This was the first significant foray into inhabiting cyberspace in an architectural manner, and although most of the environments conceived were ‘unbuildable’ in the physical world it set a precedent for other architects to follow.

With the constraints of having to design for the physical world essentially removed, Novak experimented with complex geometrical concepts in the virtual world. The first obstacle to transcend was the obvious barrier of multidimensional space, his complex parametric four dimensional designs yielded hyper-surfaces as the resultant three dimensional form. This allowed him to create architecture that doesn’t conform to our conventional Euclidean view of the world.
