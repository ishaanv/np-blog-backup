<p class="inter-paragraph">As Asymptote’s work explores the extensive realm of virtual space and how it bleeds into and interacts with real space, Greg Lynn is focused on the intensive procedures of fabrication and is concerned with bringing designs that exist in virtual space into the physical world. Although they are at the opposite ends of the spectrum of digital design their work overlaps in it’s research methods, both Rashid and Lynn teach in order to force the intellectual side of their work along much faster than if they relied on envisioned clients to
fund experimentality.</p>

<h1 id="greg">Form - Greg Lynn</h1>

Greg Lynn’s fascination with fabrication seems a little odd when considered in the context of digital design, but it becomes clearer when you consider that he is addressing the opposite side of the equation to most of the other practitioners in the digital realm, and attempting to bring the shapes designed in Maya and 3D studio out of the digital realm and into the physical one.

Nobody has addressed the issue of the creation of digitally designed spaces quite as much as Greg Lynn. The majority of problems faced when translating complex non-standard geometry from a computer into a physical object have already been surmounted by automotive, aeronautical or nautical transport industries. The ability to make any object that one can conceive pushes Lynn to conceive more and more complex shapes as his thought process is not limited by the conventional boundaries of what is possible, and by using the dense network of experimental fabrication facilities in California, Lynn is able to create virtually anything. Nearly all the concept car workshops and most of the Hollywood special effects props industry are based on the west coast.

With Lynn’s architecture taking a step into the world of machine fabrication, the final surface finish comes into question, just as when using an animation technique to find a form one must chose a moment to freeze the frame. The point along the manufacturing process where one decides that the object is finished fascinates Lynn. The intellectual decision of what defines decoration is called into play here; is an articulated artefacted surface more decorated than a smooth polished one if the polishing is an additional step in the objects production, or is decoration an addition process. Lynn explains the concept succinctly in the chapter introduction to “intricate pattern, relief and texture” where he explains how the tool path defined by the computer is created from the 3d data of the computer model, converting a complex surface made up of splines into a series of two dimensional tool sweeps. These tool sweeps leave a pattern on the surface, both from their shape and also the cutting action. A tool will often pass over the same point several times with the cutting path in a different plane to remove extra material, but as the material is removed the moiré interface patterns become a feature of the object. The way the object is produced, and it’s resultant ‘birthmarks’ are as important as the shiny smooth object that we visualise in the computer.

This unexpected, almost serendipitous result of the machine interface is carried through to other areas of Lynn’s design work. When one offsets a spline in a computer sufficiently, loops begin to appear in places of sufficient initial curvature, in most software these loops are then removed by ‘loop cutting’ algorithms because they are conventionally viewed as a software glitch. Lynn believes that in order to use software to it’s fullest you must understand what it is actually doing, then you can decide if it is working for you or against you. By switching this feature off, he has used the loop creation to design several buildings, including the Eyebeam Atelier Museum of Art and technology (competition entry in New York) and his own home in Venice Beach California. The looped splines are lofted and altered along a path and the intersections produce the defining edges of spaces.

Lynn also uses algorithms to his advantage. The Kleiberg housing block in Amsterdam (2002) is a refurbishment of an older housing project made in a single building. After careful consideration of the brief, an algorithm was written which subdivided the interior into neighbourhoods accessed by escalators. The escalators were then supported by a ribbed system that also sheltered them. The form of these ribs was defined partially by a kit of parts approach, and partially by an algorithm which interrogated the two ribs preceding it and defined its shape depending on the tension and inertia of the shape as the algorithm was run from left to right, and then from right to left to finally define their shape. This results in the surface of the building having a visually well balanced façade, whose design incorporates structural concerns and also fits the program perfectly

Lynn’s approach of combining the power of software with the intricacies of real world fabrication leads to some fascinating forms. The computer is essential to this all as its own idiosyncrasies as a medium are being explored rather than it being used to simulate a traditional process.
