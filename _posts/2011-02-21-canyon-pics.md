Here's some pics from the trip to the Blue Mountains.<br />
 <br />
I had an earlyish start, I decided at about 3:30 that the 10 to 4 train was far too early. The 10 to 7 was still full of partied out kids on their way home. I got a puncture on the way to the canyon carpark, so walked my bike a few km, and then dived into the bushes. The walk in really explained why the canyon was only 'discovered' in the 60s, there's some dense bush, followed by a trickle of water. That then becomes a slimy fall/ wet cliff, and it's only once you've got down past that that the canyon proper starts.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell canyoning is really about getting down a tight gorge with water flowing down it, whilst staying as dry as possible and avoiding getting dunked at the end of abseils.</p>
<p>I didn't actually do the grand canyon as I got onto the way out trail by mistake, and was out before I'd noticed!</p>
<p>It's the normal, obvious type of claustrophobic, and it doesn't seem to lend itself to having big or introspective thoughts, but it is fun. I'd imagine that it'd be much more fun as a group.</p>
