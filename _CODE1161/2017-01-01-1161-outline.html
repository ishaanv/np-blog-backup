    </ol>
    <p>
    This course focuses on using programming as a means of  problem solving, storytelling and creative expression for people in non-computer science fields.

Programming is simultaneously a vocational skill, a branch of philosophy, a culture, and the glue that holds the modern world together. By the end of this course you will have the philosophical tools needed to design solutions and the technical skill to implement them.
<br>
In the same way that being able to hold a pen doesn't make you a writer, being able to type code doesn't make you a programmer. So we'll learn how to manipulate symbols (type code), what those symbols mean, and how to decide which symbols to type in the first place. We'll learn simple logic and strategies for decomposing problems. We'll learn about the history and culture of computers in general, and in art and architecture.
<br>
The course will be taught through three projects.
The first will be focused on learning new skills through programming an chip based game.
Second is an AI chatbot that tries to impersonate your style.
Thirdly, we will apply our skills by exploring an open data set. We'll create graphs, maps and other visualisations from it. This will allow insight into information that was previously hidden

        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Most course related announcements are made in the lectures. It is essential that you attend the lectures to receive these announcements. In addition to these formal communication paths, online discussion forums will be available that will allow everyone to post questions and respond to other people&rsquo;s questions.</p>
    <p>Individual student related communication, including the issue of assessment grades and feedback, will be via the Moodle. UNSW Student email will be used to communicate changes that occur with short notice. All students are assigned an e-mail account on the University&#39;s e-mail server, so that email address will be used as the primary means by which important correspondence is made. You must, therefore, get into the habit of checking your UNSW student email regularly.</p>
    <p>Details on setting up your UNSW student email are provided at:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.it.unsw.edu.au/students/index.html">https://www.it.unsw.edu.au/<wbr>students/<wbr>index.html</a></p>
    <p>To manage your UNSW account and password, use the IDM site:</p>
    <p><a href="https://idm.unsw.edu.au/idm/user/login.jsp">https://idm.unsw.edu.au/<wbr><wbr>idm/<wbr><wbr>user/login.jsp</a></p>
    <p>Questions that cannot wait until the next allocated class are best handled by posting a message on the online forums in Moodle. If there are important or urgent matters that require a personal meeting, you are able make an appointment with your course staff. See <em>3. Course Staff and Contributors</em> for more information on how and when to communicate with course coordinator and tutors.</p>
    <p>If you do need to send an email, please use [this email template](https://github.com/notionparallax/code1161base/blob/master/email_template.md). Priority will be given to emails that conform to it.

    <p>Design Computing provides a theoretical and practical underpinning for the rest of the degree.</p>
    <p>Programming is many things; a vocational skill, a branch of philosophy and a culture. By the end of this course you will have the philosophical tools needed to design solutions and the technical skill to implement that plan.</p>
    <p>In the same way that being able to hold a pen doesn&#39;t make you a writer, being able to type code doesn&#39;t make you a programmer.</p>
    <p>We&#39;ll learn how to manipulate symbols (type code), what those symbols mean, and how to decide which symbols to type in the first place.</p>
    <p>We&#39;ll learn simple logic and strategies for decomposing problems.</p>
    <p>We&#39;ll learn about the history and culture of computers in general, and more specifically in architecture.</p>
    <p>The first half of the course will be focused on learning new skills, and the second on applying them.</p>
    <p>We&#39;ll be exploring an open data set and creating graphs, maps and other visualisations from it. This will allow people insight to information that was previously hidden from them.</p>

        <dd>
            <p>A lab book is a record of what you&rsquo;ve learned, what you are going to try next and a reference for next time you encounter the same problem. Students will assemble one document per week that they will post to the course&rsquo;s Medium publication (<a href="https://medium.com/code17">medium.com/code17</a>).</p>
            <p>This will cement concepts by writing about, and illustrating, them. There is also value in reading and commenting on your peers&rsquo; lab books as a way of distributing the effort of learning.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Deliverables</dt>
        <dd>14 Medium blog posts. These will be marked in two parts. Half the mark is for weekly presence; '<em>is there something posted by 7pm on Thursday?</em>' The other half will be for quality which will happen in one go in week 15, which will give time for tidying up and refinement.</p>

            <p>Each week until the mid semester break there will be tasks for you to complete. These will be briefed during the contact time. These are marked automatically, but the code used to mark them will be available to you so you can tell if your work will pass or not.</p>

        <dd>Each week at the cutoff time (7pm the following Wednesday) each student&rsquo;s GitHub repository will be read by a script and the code present will be marked. It will either pass or fail the tests. Feedback will be given in a communal way through the discussion forum. ( Week 7's submission will actually be in week 8.)</p>

        <dt>Description</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>There are deep divisions in programmer culture over seemingly trivial things. For example, the advocates of different text editors treat their allegiance with a religious fervour. Each student will pick one of these divisives and present it to their peers during the week 5 lab. the marks will be evenly split between defining the context, presenting both sides of the argument with balance, and stating their position on the matter and substantiating why they hold that belief.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Deliverables</dt>
        <dd>A 5 minute presentation in the week 5 Lab. A 20 slide presentation in Google slides format. Each slide should be set to have a 15 second automatic timer. The slides should be shared no later than 1pm on Thursday week 5. Details on sharing will be given closer to the date.</dd>

            <p>This is the capstone project for this course. You will take an open data set, probably from the NSW government collection and build a way to present it to others.</p>
            <p>You will use any available libraries or frameworks to do so, although py.processing and matplotlib are recommended. The marks will be awarded for: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Code quality: Is the code tidy, is it modular, is it self documenting, does it use efficient algorithms etc.</li>
                <li>Data manipulation: has the raw data been transformed well, and repeatably.</li>
                <li>Quality of output, is the &lsquo;front end&rsquo; of your project successful, is it supported by data visualisation and HCI principles?</li>
                <li>Depth of insight: Does your system lead to a greater understanding of the phenomenon described by the data? What did you find in the data that you wanted to share with others?</li>
                <li>Final presentation: was the presentation clear and well rehearsed? Did it get the salient points across? Was it technically deep while avoiding jargon?</li>

    <p>Write a Medium blog post detailing what you did each week. It should include links to the documentation you've used (blog posts, official docs, Stack Overflow questions, your peers' previous lab book posts) descriptions of problems you overcame, summaries of articles you've read, podcasts you've listened to and discussions you've had.</p>
    <p>Include sketches and diagrams. These can be hand drawn and then photographed. The Medium app makes this very easy.</p>

    <p>These are marked automatically in a binary way. Each exercise will attract a certain mark for a passing test and no mark for a failing test. All tests will be worth an equal amount, i.e. <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub><em>n</em></sub><sup>th</sup> of the weeks mark where <em>n</em> is the number of exercises.</p>
    <section>
        <h4>Deliverables: </h4>
        <p>At 7pm on Thursday of each week following exercises being set, an automatic process will assess your work. it will <em>pull</em> your repo from GitHub and run tests against it. Therefore the deliverable for each week will be a specific set of files in specific locations, in your GitHub repository.</p>

    <p>This will be marked automatically in exactly the same way as your weekly exercises. The only difference will be that the submission dates will be different.</p>

    <p>Marks are split evenly between each of the four parts.</p>
    <h4>Deliverables: </h4>
    <p>Students will deliver a 5 minute presentation in the week 5 Lab. A 20 slide presentation in Google slides format. Each slide will be set to have a 15 second automatic timer. The slides should be shared no later than 1pm on Thursday week 5. Details on sharing will be given closer to the date. The presentations will be joined before the lab, so not submitting will result in no mark for any part of this assignment.</p>

    <p>Students will gain information about their process in class via 3 basic levels.</p>
    <p>Firstly, The goals of the class are clearly defined in the course outline and discussed at the beginning of each Assignment and the learning steps within the assignment in the weekly lecture. Here students will understand how their performance relates to the broad goals of the course.</p>
    <p>Secondly, students will get feedback in each class (during the three tutorial hours) upon their performance. Tutors will help students in one-to-one sessions to discuss and analyse how successful they have been at addressing the task and its criteria of each assignment and the learning steps within the assignment.</p>
    <p>Thirdly, students will get feedback in each class (during the three tutorial hours) in how their response to the assignment and the learning steps within the assignment could be improved. Tutors will help students in one-to-one sessions to discuss and analyse how improvements could be made and which resources students could consult for an improvement.</p>

    <h3>Readings</h3>
    <p>This class has no mandatory reading other than that defined in the weekly lectures. However, it would be very much in your interest to read:</p>
    <section>
        <p class="reference"><strong>Coates, P.</strong> (2010). <em>Programming.Architecture</em> (1<sup>st</sup> ed.). Routledge.</p>
        <p class="summary">This is a general history and theoretical grounding for computational design as a field.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p class="reference"><strong>Woodbury, R.</strong> (2010). <em>Elements of Parametric Design.</em> Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</p>
        <p class="summary">Rob&rsquo;s book will take you through all the ideas that you&rsquo;ll need mastery of over your degree. Reading this will shortcut a lot of the pain that you are bound to encounter if you don&rsquo;t read it. I wish it had been available when I was learning.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <p class="reference"><strong>Graham, P.</strong> (2010). <em>Hackers &amp; Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age.</em></p>
        <p class="summary">A series of essays about the early-ish days of the dotcom boom and the ideas that came out of it. Graham is a controversial figure, but his essays give a lot of insight into the workings of the alpha-hacker mind.</p>

        <p class="reference"><strong>Raymond, E. S.</strong> (2001). <em>The Cathedral &amp; the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary.</em> O&rsquo;Reilly Media.</p>
        <p class="summary">This book is an introduction to some pretty subversive ideas in computing and business. It&rsquo;s got some great answers to the question of &lsquo;Am I a hacker yet?&rsquo; It&rsquo;s also a pretty enjoyable read.</p>

    <h3 id="online-resources">Online resources</h3>
    <p>GitHub will be used extensively throughout this course. It is a way for people to store, share, version control and collaborate on projects. As well as our code being hosted here, thousands of other people&rsquo;s code is too. That means that there might well be someone who has already solved your problem. (<a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>)</p>
    <p>Stack Overflow is a question and answer site for programmers. Whatever your question, there is an extremely high likelihood that it has has been asked before. It has strong community norms, so it is worth familiarising yourself with them before you post. (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">stackoverflow.com</a>)</p>
    <p>XKCD is a comic that often has references to importants. Time spent following the threads that come up here is rarely wasted. (<a href="http://xkcd.com/">xkcd.com</a>)</p>
    <p>Coding horror is the blog of Jeff Atwood, one of the creators of Stack Overflow. He takes very detailed looks into unusual subjects and makes them seem interesting and entertaining. This is useful to you because it will show you how an extremely competent programmer&rsquo;s brain works to solve problems. (<a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/">blog.codinghorror.com</a>)</p>
    <p>Solving programming programs is largely a process of getting good at working out how to search for your particular error. As such, Google and Stack Overflow will get used a lot. It&rsquo;s unusual to go into the Python docs directly usually you will be taken to the specific thing you need by Google. (<a href="https://docs.python.org/2.7/">docs.python.org/2.7</a>)</p>
    <h3 id="social network resources">Social network resources</h3>
    <p>UNSW CoDe has a Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and Youtube account and all lecturers use these accounts to share information with their students. Thus please join and follow us on @UNSWCoDe (for all above listed networks) we will use &ldquo;UNSW&rdquo; + &ldquo;CODE&rdquo; + the course number as a hashtag to help finding the relevant info (for this course #UNSWCODE1161). Feel also free to post images of your design on social media using the hashtag.</p>
    <p>Twitter is a good source for very up to date information on tech subjects. You will have to find out who to follow for yourself, but feel free to look at who I follow&#8203;&#8203;&#8203; for inspiration: <a href="http://bit.ly/NPfollows">bit.ly/NPfollows</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="class requirements">Class requirements</h3>
    <p>It is expected that you will bring your laptop to each class. Not bringing a laptop means we cannot look, comment and help you with your work, as we do not run this class in a computer classroom. Using your friend&rsquo;s laptop means that they cannot work in the time given in class and thus is not an option either.</p>
    <p>Configuring a programming environment is a considerable challenge. Dealing with edge cases can use up significant amounts of valuable teaching time. We will be using a virtual machine in the class to put a layer of abstraction between each specific hardware configuration and a consistent setup. This will mean that everyone&rsquo;s environment will start out identical.</p>
    <p>If you break your VM, instructions to restore it to fresh will be posted.</p>

    <p>The lectures and the tutorials are an integrated part of this class. Missing out on lectures will have the consequence that you will miss out on seeing and hearing about projects, ideas and concepts relevant to your understanding and progress.</p>
    <p>Programming is a mental activity. You are expected to come to to class fresh and ready to engage with challenging concepts.</p>
