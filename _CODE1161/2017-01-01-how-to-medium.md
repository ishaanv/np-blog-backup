You've written a great lab book post. You want to share it with the world. You want to share it with your peers. How?

In your `aboutMe.yml` file you filled in your Medium account name. That means that you've been added to the publication. All you need to do now is to add your posts to the publication.

1. <figure class="half-width">
![the overflow menu]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/17/publicationAdd1.png)
    <figcaption>
    Find the overflow menu dots &#8943; and click '_Add to publication_'.
    </figcaption>
    <figure>
1. <figure class="half-width">
    ![add to publication]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/17/pub2.png)
    <figcaption>
    Choose _Design computing_ and then click _Add story_
    </figcaption>
    <figure>
1. Then you are done! You can keep editing the post all week, so do this early.
1. Profit!

There's [lots of good stuff here](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/categories/200058025-Writing) about how to actually write your posts.
