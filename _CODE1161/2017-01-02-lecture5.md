This week we introduced the Open Data Project. It's worth reading the post that introduces the assignment. [It's here](https://notionparallax.co.uk/CODE1161/2017-01-04-assignment-3-brief).

A little extract of that:

>*Do these things to make your life better in the long run:*
>
> These tasks are going to feel like an imposition. They aren’t marked, but doing them will make everything so much easier. Think of it as a warm up; you don’t get any Olympic medals for warming up, but you’ll never :sports_medal::sports_medal:in one if you don’t warm up! These are good things to put into your lab book.
>
> State your question. Be very clear about what you are asking. This will make communicating with your tutors a lot easier too.
> * Document your data source. Where did you get it from? When?
>
> * Document the data. If it comes as a table, what does each column mean? What type of data is it. E.g. this is some data from an Uber data set:
>
>     `"Date/Time","Lat","Lon","Base"`
>     
>     `"4/1/2014 0:11:00",40.769,-73.9549,"B02512"`
>
>     This is fairly obvious, but what does the datetime actually mean? Is it a pick up time? Same for the lat long. What is Base?
>
>     This is a simple data set, some of the government sets have a lot more columns. Going through them and documenting their data-type and being specific about what they refer to will be really good for you.
>
> * Think about your story. In your career you’ll be looking at a data set to help you tell a story. If you know what that story is then you’ll find it a lot easier to find supporting graphs and statistics to tell it for you. (The only people I can think that this doesn’t apply to are solo investors, and even they are probably telling a story to themselves!)


So, think about what you care about in life, and then go to https://www.data.gov.au  and https://data.nsw.gov.au/  and see if anything is related to that. (edited)


By next session, we want to be able to see:
* Your subject - what are you interested in?
* A documented list of all the value types in your data, what data type they are, the ranges of values (by eye) and how each value is collected.

As a tip, I would avoid data contained in PDF files like the plague. PDF is an old format, and it's not queryable.
Its enthusiastic use by someone is a strong indicator that that person is a low quality human.

Vi Hart ripping some recursive space filling curves!

# This week's homework

Some exercises, the reading, and looking for a dataset.
