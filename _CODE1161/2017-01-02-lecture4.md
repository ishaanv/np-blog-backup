# This week's homework

Make sure that you've real all the readings :books:, :headphones: etc. From all the weeks. Maybe re-read the early ones, they might make more sense now.

Redo as many of the exercises as you feel you need to until you feel fluent with them.

Take a look at these. Watch this one:

You might want to find out more about Alan Kay, he's an interesting character in his own right.

Don't watch all of this, but flick through it. Almost everything demoed here is new in this demo.
