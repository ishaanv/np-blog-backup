# The plan

The holy wars presentations are going to be fast paced!!

You have a few things that you *must* do.
* Work out which group you're going to be in.
* Work out who is before you.
* Write down your github username. (There will be postit notes for that.)

Then the way it's going to work will be:
1. First person will present. <small>They get an easy ride because they don't have a change over!</small>
2. Second person hands their postit to the marker as they step up to present.
3. Second person presents. No need to touch anything because the deck will auto advance.

That's about it until we finish!
