Is ∆ change caused by the communication improvement provided by the internet going to run out soon?


This idea was first seeded in my brain by Robin Hanson talking about how we are due for another big population/<span class="small-caps">gdp</span> explosion. His argument was that there were clear explosions of population[^1] that corresponded to the invention of agriculture, the industrial evolution and

[^1]: for most of history <span class="small-caps">gdp</span> and population have been almost exactly linked. Any increase in production beyond subsistance living would result in a population increase. Correspondingly any <span class="small-caps">gdp</span> decrease would result in population decreases due to famine. There would be abberations like tribal leaders or when the famine-plenty cycle went more quickly than population could keep up, but that has only really started to be a big thing in the last 3-4 thousand years. (All a guess, but it feels consistent.)

> The railroad was invented to solve a problem: moving coal from the mines to the piers, where it could be loaded on ships or barges. But the railroad addressed a broader and more basic need: moving things around quickly and cheaply. It did more than move coal from mine to ship, it moved goods from city to city, it moved mail from city to city, it moved people from city to city, and those people started living away from their hometowns en masse for the first time. These uses then enabled many other industries to flourish. This is the difference between a technological revolution and a plain old technological system: a technological revolution changes the whole economy.
