description: I have some sort of grasp on now, and on parts of the future. It's frustrating to do things that don't directly address that future.

I'm not claiming to be able to predict what will _actually_ happen in the future, but I do feel like I can make guesses about certain parts of the future with more confidence than others. I'm probably no better than chance at guessing what will happen in spectator sports in the next 10 years. On the other hand, I feel like I have some insight into the things that I think about a lot.

My biases are probably rampant here, I continually refine a version of the future that feels fairly detailed[^1]. I'm able to defend that future pretty well, and I feel like I'm able to change my mind based on new information and my vision of the future doesn't change all that much. That probably means that my vision is robust to minor changes in initial conditions. Which is either good because it's right, or bad because it's so trivial that it's not worth thinking about[^2]. 

I've noticed myself being frustrated several times when I come across things that are related to the bits of the future that I feel high confidence about. Doing things that address the _now_ are annoying because they aren't addressing the _future_.

I need to start to see that gap as where opportunity lies. Doing things that don't address the future directly _is_ going to be frustrating, but the world isn't ready for it yet. Maybe the technology isn't there, or society isn't ready yet, but as I [said the other day](http://notionparallax.co.uk/2016/progress-enabling-more-progress) it's about stacking the deck in my favour so that the things I do support the direction I want to go in. 

This feels like the essence of _strategy_, and it's a bit depressing that it's taken so long for me to actually realise this. It hadn't clicked that strategy worked at lots of scales, like nesting dolls[^4].

Being successful in strategy must rely on having goals at different scales. I'm not very good at this, and my goal machinery feels as if it's mainly subconscious. 



[^1]: Maybe it's the one where [Linda the feminist bank teller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy) works on the moon and commutes in her orange space car.

[^2]: I.e. predicting that in the future, the year part of the date will be a bigger number.

[^3]: In a recursive quoting nightmare, I quoted this in my [dip thesis](http://notionparallax.co.uk/2015/major-study-design-under-conditions-of-uncertainty-calibration-design-hitting-a-moving-target-in-the-dark). Here's the footnote attached to it there:
    
    > This quote can also be attributed to an argument between an environmentalist and an economist. The environmentalist made some predictions about how resource prices in the future would rise as a result of some sort of ecological disaster. The economist responded with “If you are so smart, why aren't you rich?” The argument was settled with a bet, if the resource prices did rise in line with the environmentalist's predictions the economist would pay out a nominal sum (a few thousand dollars) and vice versa. Unfortunately the source of this parable completely escapes me, so this quote is taken from a Batman cartoon.
