One of the greatest obstacles to designing a workplace for a group of architects, designers and other associated people is that we donâ€™t know what they actually _do_!

This is a problem as any proposal for a workplace design is going to predicated on assumption. Perhaps there are things that the designer _knows_ to be true; being one themselves of course. Maybe they did interviews, and the participants reported their behaviour. This would seem to be a responsible way to do this, if it wasn't for the giant corpus of literature on self reporting bias. [_get some references, a quick look produced so many that combing them for the few best ones might take a while!_]

# Proposal

Quite simply, to assign a person to shadow a representative sample of people from a large architecture firm. That shadow person would be with the shadowed person for their whole working day. They would put together a time line of the tasks undertaken by the subject, and make observations about those tasks. E.g. where they were, what supporting technology was used (paper, telephone, email, smartphone, virtual reality, particular software) and some other things that we can establish later, like does this task seem repetitive, does it appear to be delegate-able (or is this person the only one who could do it).

This is quite an extensible idea as the base is easy to implement (assuming sound experimental design) but could be augmented in lots of ways. Without reducing the efficacy of the base method you could add: tracking tools like Rescue Time, email tracking, revit analytics, phone tracking (via ifttt). That would add richness and error checking.

# How to do it

* Find 5-10 people who are trustworthy and personable to be the recorders. I.e. perform the field work.
* Pick 20 people who are representative of a vertical slice of the BVN hierarchy. (Extend to other practices of different scales on further work.)
* Randomly assign a reporter on a given day to a subject. Make sure that the subject doesn't change their plans. The reporter should follow the subject in every way possible. (Excepting toilet breaks and meetings that need security clearance.)
* aggregate data and analyse.


# Further work

Something else to consider is that this work impacts directly on the discussion of the automatability of architects. I've [written about this a little in the past](https://notionparallax.co.uk/2015/architects-getting-automated) and have a it more to write when I get onto it. (About how _jobs_ are accumulations of _tasks_ and jobs can't eb automated, but once you eliminate enough tasks...)

Once we have a solid method we can extend it to other practices of differing sizes to get more data.

The initial study would make a great, and marketable paper, and the follow ups would too.
